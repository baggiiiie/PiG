# Knowledge graph

The entities Pig is built from, how they relate, where each lives, and the command that inspects it. Use it to locate a concept before reading its page; each row links the page to read next.

| Entity | What it is | Where it lives | Inspect with | Read |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pi | Upstream TypeScript coding agent; the behavior oracle. | `https://github.com/earendil-works/pi` | `pig version` | [divergences.md](divergences.md) |
| PiG | The Go implementation; executable pig. | `internal/coding/pigversion/pigversion.go pins Pi` | `pig verify` | [README.md](README.md) |
| Stock PiG | Product-neutral pig binary with no Piglet selected. | `cmd/pig` | `pig version` | [built-in-extensions.md](built-in-extensions.md) |
| Session | Append-only JSONL tree of entries for one conversation. | `~/.pig/agent/sessions` | `/tree, /session` | [sessions.md](sessions.md) |
| Model Runtime | Session-owned model lookup, auth, completion, and streaming used by every mode. | `coding/` | `/model, pig --list-models` | [models.md](models.md) |
| Provider | Turns a Transcript into one Event Stream for one API. | `ai/` | `pig --list-models` | [providers.md](providers.md) |
| Mode | Interactive TUI, print, JSON event stream, or RPC over stdin/stdout. | `cmd/pig` | `pig --mode rpc` | [commands.md](commands.md) |
| Resource | One capability: extension, skill, prompt, hook, MCP definition, theme, or environment. | `~/.pig/agent, .pig/ in a project` | `pig status --json` | [concepts.md](concepts.md) |
| Extension | Code Resource in Go, Rust, Python, or Node/TypeScript that registers tools, commands, events, and UI. | `extensions/sdk*, ~/.pig/agent/extensions` | `pig install --validate-only <dir>` | [extensions.md](extensions.md) |
| Extension SDK | One extension contract per language: Go, Rust, Python, TypeScript declarations. | `extensions/sdk, sdk-rs, sdk-py, sdk-ts` | `pig extension init` | [extension-api.md](extension-api.md) |
| Extension realization | How an extension runs: isolated process, packed runtime cell, or fused into a Piglet Binary (Go only). | `coding/extension/host` | `pig status --json` | [runtime-cells.md](runtime-cells.md) |
| Extension Host | Loads, isolates, reloads, and shuts down extension realizations over one wire contract. | `coding/extension/host/subprocess` | `/reload` | [runtime-cells.md](runtime-cells.md) |
| Package | Versioned collection of Resources from npm, git, or a local path; never owns a Piglet. | `~/.pig/agent/npm, ~/.pig/agent/git` | `pig list` | [packages.md](packages.md) |
| Piglet | One named agent: selects and scopes Resources and sets defaults. | `*.yaml Piglet file` | `pig piglet validate <file>` | [piglets.md](piglets.md) |
| PiG Standard | The optional curated Piglet: login identity, PiG Runner, Angry Pigs. | `piglets/standard/pig-standard.yaml` | `pig piglet validate piglets/standard/pig-standard.yaml` | [built-in-extensions.md](built-in-extensions.md) |
| Piglet release | Pins the exact Resource closure and component plan of a Piglet. | `release.version and managed records` | `pig piglet show --record <path>` | [piglets.md](piglets.md) |
| Piglet Binary | Target-native pig executable for one Piglet release; verifies its closure at startup. | `pig piglet build --format binary` | `pig verify` | [piglets.md](piglets.md) |
| Builder | Produces Piglet Binaries: native (needs Go and PiG source) or container (needs Docker or Podman). | `coding/pigletbuild` | `pig setup` | [piglets.md](piglets.md) |
| Pig Porter | Parity workbench Piglet Resource; proposes ports, never accepts its own work. | `piglets/porter` | `make porter-check (source checkout)` | [divergences.md](divergences.md) |
| Divergence | A numbered, approved, user-visible difference from pinned Pi. | `docs/parity/DIVERGENCES.md` | `pig docs show divergences` | [divergences.md](divergences.md) |

| PiG Standard | is a | Piglet | explicit, never active in Stock |
| Piglet release | pins | Piglet | exact closure |
| Piglet Binary | realizes | Piglet release | per target |
| Builder | produces | Piglet Binary | no silent fallback between builders |

| Divergence | documents difference from | Pi | numbered D<N> |
