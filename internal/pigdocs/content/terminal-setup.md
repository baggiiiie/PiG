# Terminal setup

Pig runs in any terminal. Some features need terminal support, and Pig turns each
one on only when it detects that support. This page lists what Pig detects, and
what to change when a key or an image does not work.

## What Pig detects

Pig reads environment variables to decide what your terminal accepts. It does not
ask the terminal, because a terminal that does not answer would delay startup.

| Terminal | Images | True color | Hyperlinks |
|---|---|---|---|
| Kitty | yes | yes | yes |
| Ghostty | yes | yes | yes |
| WezTerm | yes | yes | yes |
| iTerm2 | yes | yes | yes |
| Warp | yes | yes | yes |
| VS Code | no | yes | yes |
| Alacritty | no | yes | yes |
| Zed | no | yes | yes |
| Windows Terminal | no | yes | yes |
| JetBrains | no | yes | no |
| Apple Terminal | no | with `COLORTERM` | no |

Inside `tmux` or `screen`, Pig turns images off. The multiplexer
sits between Pig and the terminal, so what the outer terminal accepts is not
evidence that the pane accepts it. Hyperlinks stay off in `screen`. In `tmux`,
Pig asks tmux whether the attached client forwards hyperlinks and uses them
only when it does.

Pig reads `TERM_PROGRAM`, `TERM` and `COLORTERM` first. It also accepts
`KITTY_WINDOW_ID`, `GHOSTTY_RESOURCES_DIR`, `WEZTERM_PANE`, `ITERM_SESSION_ID`,
`WARP_SESSION_ID` and `WT_SESSION` as evidence, because some terminals set only
these. A terminal it does not recognize gets true color only with
`COLORTERM=truecolor` or `COLORTERM=24bit`, and no images or hyperlinks.

To correct detection, set `PI_HYPERLINKS`, `PI_IMAGE_PROTOCOL` or `PI_TRUE_COLOR`
(see [environment variables](environment-variables.md)), or the matching
`terminal.*` setting (see [settings](settings.md)). The setting wins.

## Keys that do not respond

A terminal sends a key to Pig only if it does not use the key itself. When a
binding does nothing, the terminal usually consumed the key.

Check first whether the key works outside Pig. If the terminal has a command
bound to it, unbind the command or bind the Pig action to a different key. See
[keybindings](keybindings.md).

### tmux

`tmux` must send extended keys, or modified keys such as `shift+enter` and
`ctrl+enter` arrive as their unmodified form. Pig warns at startup when it finds
the wrong setting.

Add both lines to `~/.tmux.conf` and restart tmux:

```tmux
set -g extended-keys on
set -g extended-keys-format csi-u
```

`extended-keys-format xterm` also sends modified keys, but in a format that
carries less information. Pig warns about it and works better with `csi-u`.

Pig does not warn when it cannot query tmux, because a sandbox that blocks the
query is not evidence of a wrong setting.

### Apple Terminal

Pig enables enhanced key reporting when available. If Terminal.app still sends
plain Return for `shift+enter`, Pig asks macOS whether Shift is held and
treats the key as `shift+enter`. This works only when Pig runs on the same Mac
as Terminal.app. Over SSH, Pig cannot see the local modifier state.

### Termux

Termux reports its window size differently from a desktop terminal. Pig detects
Termux with `TERMUX_VERSION` and does not repaint the whole buffer when the
window changes, because the repaint costs more than it corrects there.

## Images

Pig shows images when the terminal accepts the Kitty graphics protocol or the
iTerm2 protocol. In every other terminal Pig writes the file path instead, so no
information is lost.

Images are off inside `tmux` and `screen`. To see images, run Pig outside the
multiplexer, or set `PI_IMAGE_PROTOCOL` when you know the multiplexer forwards
them.

## Display problems

| Symptom | Cause | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| Pig exits with `Rendered line N exceeds terminal width` | a component wrote a row wider than the terminal | fix the component to truncate its rows to the render width; the crash log lists every rendered row with its width |
| colors look wrong | the terminal reports no true color | set `COLORTERM=truecolor` if the terminal supports it |
| a stray `[?62;22c` appears | the terminal answered a capability query late | Pig consumes this answer; report it with the terminal name |

Set `PIG_RENDER_DEBUG` to any value to write render diagnostics. Use it when you
report a display problem.

As in Pi, a row wider than the terminal is fatal only when it reaches a differential render. Pig then writes `pi-tui-crash.log` to the agent directory (the system temp directory when there is none) with the terminal width, the offending row and its width, and every rendered row, restores the terminal, prints the error with the log path, and exits with status 1. The first render, a forced full render, and the full render after a resize emit an over-wide row unchanged.
