// FileMutationQueue serialises concurrent mutations targeting the same
// canonical file path, in the order callers entered With. Operations on
// different files proceed in parallel.
//
// Mirrors upstream core/tools/file-mutation-queue.ts::withFileMutationQueue,
// which chains a per-file Promise so mutations for one file apply in the
// order withFileMutationQueue was called, and drops the map entry once the
// chain drains. Upstream additionally serialises the async key-resolution
// step itself through a package-level registrationQueue so that admission
// order matches call order even though realpath is async; pig's key
// resolution (canonicalKey) is synchronous, so admission and key resolution
// happen inside the same lock/unlock section below, giving the same
// call-order guarantee without a separate queue.
//
// A single per-key sync.Mutex is not equivalent: two goroutines that both
// see the mutex missing (or unlocked) race, unsynchronised, to acquire it,
// so a goroutine that entered With later can still win and run its callback
// before an earlier caller. The chain below removes that race by deciding
// each caller's position atomically, under q.mu, and having callers wait on
// a channel handed to them at that moment rather than a second Lock() race.
