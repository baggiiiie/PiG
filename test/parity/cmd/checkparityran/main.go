// Command checkparityran answers one question: did the parity suite
// actually compare pig against a real pi, or did it just skip?
//
// TestParity (test/parity/runner/runner_test.go) resolves the pig-under-test and
// upstream-pi binaries before it does anything else. When PIG_PARITY_PIG_BIN
// (or PIG_BIN) is unset, or tmux/pi 0.87.1 is missing, those resolvers call
// t.Skip with an explicit reason and TestParity's body returns immediately -
// no scenario ever runs, and `--pig-parity.results` is never written. `go
// test` still exits 0 for that run, because a skipped test is not a failed
// test, so `make parity` alone cannot tell "0 scenarios ran" apart from
// "every scenario passed" without checking the results file.
//
// This command reads that results file and prints the number of scenario
// outcomes it contains. The Makefile treats 0 as a hard failure (see
// require-parity-ran in automation/make/parity.mk) unless the caller
// explicitly opts out. A missing results file counts as zero outcomes
// rather than an error, since a missing file is exactly what a wholesale
// skip produces.
