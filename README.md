PiG is [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi), the minimal and extensible coding agent for the terminal, rebuilt in Go as one native binary. It starts quickly, needs no Node.js, and runs Pi's TypeScript extensions unchanged. You can also write extensions in Go, Rust, or Python, and bundle extensions, skills, and prompts into a Piglet: one named agent you can share or build into its own executable.

PiG is a pre-stable 0.x release. Core paths are ported and checked against Pi 0.87.1 with paired parity scenarios; edge cases are still hardening. See the [port status](test/parity/coverage.md) and [file map](docs/parity/PORT_MAP.md) for current scope and evidence.

If PiG behaves differently from Pi, that is either a bug or a documented divergence. Windows support is a preview.

## Install

On macOS or Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pi-in-go.dev/install.sh | sh
```

On Windows, in PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://pi-in-go.dev/install.ps1 | iex
```

With npm, on any supported platform:

```bash
npm install -g @pi-in-go/pig
```

With Go:

```bash
go install github.com/MichaelKinsy/PiG/cmd/pig@latest
```

You can also download an archive from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/MichaelKinsy/PiG/releases) or [build from source](#build-from-source). [pi-in-go.dev/install](https://pi-in-go.dev/install) covers every method, including updates and uninstalling.

## Quick start

Start PiG in the directory where you want it to work, run `/login` to connect a subscription or set your provider's API key (for example `OPENAI_API_KEY`), then ask it something:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
pig
```

Interactive `/login` masks secret input by default. Turn off **Mask secret input** in `/settings` to restore Pi's plain-text typing and submitted input (D80). See [login privacy](docs/site/docs/providers.md#authentication).

The [documentation](https://pi-in-go.dev/docs/latest) covers everything else, starting with the [quickstart](https://pi-in-go.dev/docs/latest/quickstart). You can also ask PiG to explain itself.

## Upstream Pi

Pi is the reference implementation. PiG follows Pi's behavior and design unless a Go constraint or an approved product-neutral requirement makes a difference necessary.

Use the upstream project for Pi itself:

- [Pi source](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi)
- [Pi documentation](https://pi.dev/docs/latest)
- [Earendil Works](https://github.com/earendil-works)
- [Pi community](https://discord.com/invite/3cU7Bz4UPx)

PiG is not an official Pi release. The Pi maintainers do not endorse PiG.

## Origins

Michael Kinsy created PiG working at Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

PiG is maintained as an independent open-source project. Project decisions, issues, and contributions belong in this repository. See [docs/project/GOVERNANCE.md](docs/project/GOVERNANCE.md) and [docs/project/MAINTAINERS.md](docs/project/MAINTAINERS.md).

## Compatibility philosophy

PiG adds a Go implementation to the Pi ecosystem and follows the Pi reference implementation.

- Preserve observable compatibility with Pi.
- Treat the pinned Pi release as the reference behavior.
- Minimize unnecessary divergence.
- Record each intentional user-visible or interoperability difference.
- Prefer changes that reduce the cost of the next upstream sync.
- Share generally useful findings with the broader ecosystem when the contribution route permits it.

The pinned Pi release is 0.87.1 at commit `f07218c4d4bbc12bef056a7058c3dd49dfe41abe`. The pin names the behavior oracle. It does not claim that every upstream change is already ported: [`test/parity/coverage.md`](test/parity/coverage.md) reports verified behavior, and the upgrade ledgers under [`test/parity/upstream-sync/`](test/parity/upstream-sync/) list each upstream change and its disposition.

PiG's current package scope covers Pi's agent, AI, coding-agent, and TUI
packages. It does not implement Pi's experimental remote Session packages or
its standalone telemetry and evaluation packages. See
[`docs/parity/PORT_MAP.md`](docs/parity/PORT_MAP.md) for the exact boundary.

## Project facts

- Binary: `pig`
- Go module: `github.com/MichaelKinsy/PiG`
- Configuration root: `~/.pig/`, or `PIG_HOME`
- Agent directory: `~/.pig/agent`, or `PIG_CODING_AGENT_DIR`
- Pi version pin: [`internal/coding/pigversion/pigversion.go`](internal/coding/pigversion/pigversion.go)
- Local upstream mirror: `.upstream/current/`
- Main verification gate: `make check`
- Full verification and coverage refresh: `make verify`

`pig --version` prints PiG's version as `<PiG release>+<Pi release>`, for example `0.2.0+0.87.1` (D63): the Pi release is semver build metadata, so the version sorts as the PiG release. `pig version` prints the PiG release and the pinned Pi release as separate fields. Neither command reads user configuration.

| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agent/`      | Pi-compatible Agent loop, messages, and harness Session state.                     |
| `ai/`         | Pi-compatible providers, model catalog, authentication, and streaming types.       |
| `coding/`     | Public coding-agent SDK, extension contracts, Package support, and Piglet support. |

| `internal/`   | Private implementation used by Stock PiG. External modules cannot import it.       |
| `extensions/` | Go, Rust, Python, and declaration-only TypeScript extension SDKs.                  |
| `piglets/`    | Explicit agent compositions such as PiG Standard and Pig Porter.                   |
| `test/parity/`     | Pinned Pi correspondence, scenarios, inventories, and generated evidence.          |
| `test/`      | Integration, extension-conformance, clean-repository, and upstream-contract tests. |
| `docs/`       | Maintainer references and the static public documentation site.                    |
| `examples/`   | Small extension and embedding examples.                                            |
| `automation/` | Build, generation, CI, release, layout, and maintainer tooling. |

PiG aligns public package boundaries with Pi's `agent`, `ai`, `coding-agent`,
and `tui` packages. Go files within a package follow cohesive implementation
responsibilities instead of mirroring TypeScript file mechanics. `docs/parity/PORT_MAP.md`
records every source correspondence.

## Stock PiG and compositions

Stock PiG is the product-neutral binary built from this repository. It does not
activate PiG Standard Resources, product authentication, product APIs, or
deployment-specific behavior.

A Piglet explicitly selects Resources, tools, discovery, defaults, and environment requirements for one agent. A Package distributes Resources. A Package never owns or activates a Piglet. A Piglet Binary is a direct executable build output for one pinned Piglet composition.

PiG Standard is the explicit Piglet at
[`piglets/standard/pig-standard.yaml`](piglets/standard/pig-standard.yaml).
It currently selects the extension-provided PiG login, sprite catalogue, and
PiG Runner. Run it from source with:

```bash
pig --piglet piglets/standard/pig-standard.yaml
```

Stock PiG never selects this composition implicitly. A Package can distribute
its Resources, but a Package cannot own or activate the Piglet.

See [CONTEXT.md](docs/project/CONTEXT.md) and [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for the project terms and documentation map.

## Security boundary

PiG runs with the permissions of the user who starts it. PiG does not provide a security sandbox for model output, tools, extensions, skills, hooks, or shell commands.

Use a container, virtual machine, or another operating-system boundary when you need isolation. Load extensions and project instructions only from sources you trust. See [.github/SECURITY.md](.github/SECURITY.md).

## Install with npm

Install the command with npm (Node.js 18 or newer):

```bash
npm install -g @pi-in-go/pig
pig --version
```

Or run it once without installing:

```bash
npx @pi-in-go/pig --version
```

`pig` itself is the native binary: npm installs the matching platform package
(`@pi-in-go/pig-<os>-<cpu>`, for macOS, Linux and Windows on x64 and arm64) as
an optional dependency, and Node.js runs only a small launcher. Do not install
with `--omit=optional` or `--no-optional`, which leaves the binary out. Update
with `npm update -g @pi-in-go/pig` and uninstall with
`npm uninstall -g @pi-in-go/pig`. `pig update` does not replace an
npm-installed binary; update through npm.

## Install with Go

Install the command without a source checkout with Go 1.26 or newer:

```bash
go install github.com/MichaelKinsy/PiG/cmd/pig@latest
```

Go writes the `pig` executable to `GOBIN`, or to the `bin` directory of the first
`GOPATH` entry when `GOBIN` is unset: `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`, which is
`~/go/bin` by default (`%USERPROFILE%\go\bin` on Windows). Add that directory to
`PATH`. With an older Go 1.21 or later and the default `GOTOOLCHAIN=auto`, Go
downloads a new enough toolchain automatically. Release binaries are built with
Go 1.27.1.

Use an exact release such as `@v0.2.0` when reproducibility matters. Update a Go
installation by running `go install` again. Each release tags the root module
(`v0.2.0`) and the Go extension SDK module (`extensions/sdk/v0.2.0`) on the same
commit; `go install` needs both.

## Build from source

PiG currently supports source builds on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Do not treat a platform as release-supported until its native release verification passes.

Requirements:

- Go 1.27.1
- Git
- macOS 13 or later for native macOS builds
- Node.js 24.19.0 and npm 12.1.0 for parity tooling
- Python 3.12 for Python SDK tests
- Rust 1.97.1 for Rust SDK tests
- tmux for terminal parity tests on Unix

Build the binary:

```bash
go build -o bin/pig ./cmd/pig
./bin/pig --version
```

Prepare the exact Pi comparator and source mirror:

```bash
make upstream-mirror
```

Run the main local gate:

```bash
make check
```

The `upstream-mirror` target installs the lockfile-pinned Pi package. It retrieves the exact tagged Pi source and verifies its commit against [`internal/coding/pigversion/pigversion.go`](internal/coding/pigversion/pigversion.go).

## Contract model

- `.upstream/current/` is the local source-language mirror.
- Go code is the target implementation.
- [`docs/parity/PORT_MAP.md`](docs/parity/PORT_MAP.md) maps tracked upstream files.
- `test/parity/scenarios/` records observed behavior.
- [`test/parity/coverage.md`](test/parity/coverage.md) reports generated verification status.
- [`docs/parity/DIVERGENCES.md`](docs/parity/DIVERGENCES.md) records intentional differences.
- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) defines maintenance rules.
- [`Makefile`](Makefile) defines build, test, parity, and release gates.

A ported row means that code exists. It does not prove behavioral compatibility. A non-deferred scenario must exercise and assert the mapped behavior.

## Extensions

PiG supports Go, Rust, Python, and Node extension factories through its public extension host. Extensions can register tools, commands, event handlers, flags, shortcuts, providers, and user-interface contributions.

Node extensions use Pi's TypeScript extension API. PiG supplies compatible
runtime modules. The declaration-only package in `extensions/sdk-ts` adds types
for PiG-only extension capabilities without replacing Pi's TypeScript runtime.

Start with:

- [Extension authoring](docs/extension-authoring.md)
- [Extension API parity](docs/extension-api-parity.md)
- [Extension runtime cells](docs/extension-runtime-cells.md)

Use `pig extension init <directory>` to scaffold an extension. Use `pig install <path> --validate-only --json` to validate it.

## Supply-chain evidence

PiG treats scanner output as evidence input, not as proof by itself. Release preparation builds a validated dependency inventory and artifact-specific SPDX SBOMs. Reviewers reconcile scanner findings with Go modules, npm locks, Python metadata, Rust locks, embedded assets, generated data, and release contents.

See [docs/supply-chain.md](docs/supply-chain.md) for the inventory, SBOM, vulnerability, license, signing, and provenance requirements.
