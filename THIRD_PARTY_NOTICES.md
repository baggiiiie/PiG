# Third-Party Notices

This file records third-party software that PiG distributes in its source tree or embeds in its output. The release SBOM records dependencies compiled or packaged for each release.

The canonical license texts for the components below are in `LICENSES/`.

## ICU 78.3 CJK word segmentation

Source: <https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/tree/release-78.3/icu4c/source>

Distributed files: `internal/wordsegmenter/cjk.go` and `internal/wordsegmenter/cjk_dictionary.bin`.

- Copyright © 2016 and later Unicode, Inc. and others.
- Copyright 2006–2016 International Business Machines Corporation and others.
- The dictionary includes the Google, TaBE, Academia Sinica, and IPADIC notices reproduced in `LICENSES/LicenseRef-ICU-CJK.txt`.
- License texts: `LICENSES/Unicode-3.0.txt` and `LICENSES/LicenseRef-ICU-CJK.txt`.

PiG translates ICU's weighted CJK word-boundary algorithm to Go. The embedded index is generated from the exact ICU 78.3 `cjdict.txt` data used by the pinned Node oracle. Its source SHA256 is `e73fd72048981d0cc13e9dc436a7eaba07ffb6eff58c8a59dc75c1df746663a0`.


## ICU 78.3 Southeast Asian word segmentation

Source: <https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/tree/release-78.3/icu4c/source>

Distributed files: `internal/wordsegmenter/sea.go`, `internal/wordsegmenter/segments.go`, `internal/wordsegmenter/word_rules.go`, `internal/wordsegmenter/rule_data.go`, the Thai/Lao/Khmer/Burmese `*_dictionary.bin` indexes, and the dictionary-derived differential corpus in `internal/wordsegmenter/testdata/sea-icu78.json`.

- Copyright © 2016 and later Unicode, Inc. and others.
- Copyright 1999–2016 International Business Machines Corporation and others.
- Copyright 2006–2015 International Business Machines Corporation, Apple Inc., and others.
- The Lao dictionary includes the notice of Brian Eugene Wilson and Robert Martin Campbell (2013).
- The Burmese dictionary includes the notice of LeRoy Benjamin Sharon (2013), with thanks to Robert Martin Campbell.
- Complete dictionary notices and redistribution terms: `LICENSES/LicenseRef-ICU-SEA.txt`.
- ICU algorithm and Unicode 17.0.0 property-data terms: `LICENSES/Unicode-3.0.txt`.

PiG translates ICU's `DictionaryBreakEngine`, `PossibleWord`, `ThaiBreakEngine`, `LaoBreakEngine`, `KhmerBreakEngine`, `BurmeseBreakEngine`, `DictionaryCache::populateDictionary` engine selection, `UnhandledEngine`, and word-rule tailoring to Go. `internal/wordsegmenter/generate_sea_dictionary.py` verifies each source hash and preserves ICU's byte-offset transform in a sorted embedded index. The generator and `internal/wordsegmenter/README.md` record the exact source hashes and regeneration procedure.

## cross-spawn 7.0.6 and dependencies

Source: <https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn>

Distributed root: `coding/extension/host/subprocess/runtime-node/shims/cross-spawn/`. The package and its exact pinned production dependencies are copied without source changes by `automation/gen/vendor-node-dependencies.mjs`. Paths below are relative to this root. Each package retains its complete license text and copyright notice.

`internal/crossspawn` also translates cross-spawn's Windows command parsing and escaping, including shebang-command and shebang-regex, into Go. The Go translation retains the same MIT notices.

| Package | Version | Copyright | License | Notice path |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| cross-spawn | 7.0.6 | Copyright (c) 2018 Made With MOXY Lda <hello@moxy.studio> | MIT | `LICENSE` |

## jiti 2.7.0

The Node extension runtime loads TypeScript and JavaScript extensions with the same loader, release and options Pi 0.87.1 uses. `coding/extension/host/subprocess/runtime-node/shims/jiti/` holds the unmodified `lib/` and `dist/` directories, `package.json` and `LICENSE` of the npm package `jiti@2.7.0` (integrity `sha512-AC/7JofJvZGrrneWNaEnJeOLUx+JlGt7tNa0wZiRPT4MY1wmfKjt2+6O2p2uz2+skll8OZZmJMNqeke7kKbNgQ==`), copied by `automation/gen/vendor-pi-dist.sh`. As published, `dist/jiti.cjs` and `dist/babel.cjs` bundle jiti's own dependencies: Babel 7 and its plugins, acorn, mlly, pathe, get-tsconfig, json5 and others under the MIT license, and semver 6 under the ISC license.

## Independent Node SDK dependencies

`automation/gen/vendor-pi-dist.sh` copies the following exact production dependencies from the locked Pi 0.87.1 installation. Paths are relative to `coding/extension/host/subprocess/runtime-node/shims/`. Each package retains its published manifest and complete license. The Photon package includes its published WebAssembly image-processing asset; it is not an extension runtime.

| Package | Version | License | Retained notice and license |
|---|---|---|---|
| chalk | 6.0.0 | MIT | `chalk/license` |
| undici | 8.10.2 | MIT | `undici/LICENSE` |
| semver | 7.8.5 | ISC | `semver/LICENSE` |
| minimatch | 10.2.6 | BlueOak-1.0.0 | `minimatch/LICENSE.md` |
| brace-expansion | 5.0.9 | MIT | `minimatch/node_modules/brace-expansion/LICENSE` |
| balanced-match | 4.0.4 | MIT | `minimatch/node_modules/brace-expansion/node_modules/balanced-match/LICENSE.md` |
| hosted-git-info | 9.0.3 | ISC | `hosted-git-info/LICENSE` |
| lru-cache | 11.4.0 | BlueOak-1.0.0 | `hosted-git-info/node_modules/lru-cache/LICENSE.md` |

| @silvia-odwyer/photon-node | 0.3.4 | Apache-2.0 | `photon-node/LICENSE.md` |
| proper-lockfile | 4.1.2 | MIT | `proper-lockfile/LICENSE` |
| retry | 0.12.0 | MIT | `proper-lockfile/node_modules/retry/License` |
| graceful-fs | 4.2.11 | ISC | `proper-lockfile/node_modules/graceful-fs/LICENSE` |
| signal-exit | 3.0.7 | ISC | `proper-lockfile/node_modules/signal-exit/LICENSE.txt` |

The Blue Oak Model License is also reproduced in `LICENSES/BlueOak-1.0.0.txt`. Copyright holders appear in the retained files and `NOTICE`. No dependency resolves from the network at extension load time.

`internal/nodesemver` translates the semver 7.8.5 version and range parsing that Pi's package manager calls into Go. The Go translation retains the same ISC notice, Copyright (c) Isaac Z. Schlueter and Contributors, reproduced in `LICENSES/ISC.txt`.

## Go encoding/json

`extensions/sdk/json/` derives from the Go Authors' Go 1.27.1 `src/encoding/json` implementation, with lossless UTF-16 surrogate handling for the extension wire. It retains the Go Authors' copyright headers and BSD-3-Clause license in `extensions/sdk/json/LICENSE`. `extensions/sdk/json/README.md` records the source files and local modifications. The SDK source bundle carries this license.

## Unicode 17.0.0 character data

The generated `tui/widthx/unicode_tables.go` derives character properties and emoji sequences from the Unicode Character Database and Unicode emoji data, pinned in `tui/widthx/gen/inputs.sha256`. Copyright © 1991-2026 Unicode, Inc. Used under Unicode License V3, reproduced in `LICENSES/Unicode-3.0.txt` (source: https://www.unicode.org/license.txt). This data license supplements the MIT license for the Go implementation.
