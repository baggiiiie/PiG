PiG exposes its coding agent as Go packages. Use the SDK when a Go application needs to create and control PiG sessions without starting the command-line interface as a child process.

Use RPC mode when the caller is not a Go program or when a process boundary is required.

## Module

```text
github.com/MichaelKinsy/PiG
```

PiG is under active development. Pin an exact release or commit when you embed it. Do not assume API stability before the first public release.

After the repository and version tags are public, use the generated API reference
on pkg.go.dev:

- [`github.com/MichaelKinsy/PiG`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/MichaelKinsy/PiG)
- [`github.com/MichaelKinsy/PiG/agent`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/MichaelKinsy/PiG/agent)
- [`github.com/MichaelKinsy/PiG/ai`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/MichaelKinsy/PiG/ai)
- [`github.com/MichaelKinsy/PiG/coding`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/MichaelKinsy/PiG/coding)
- [`github.com/MichaelKinsy/PiG/tui`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/MichaelKinsy/PiG/tui)
- [`github.com/MichaelKinsy/PiG/extensions/sdk`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/MichaelKinsy/PiG/extensions/sdk)

The extension SDK is a nested Go module. Its module version uses the tag prefix
`extensions/sdk/`, while the command and other public packages use the root
module tag.

## Minimal flow
"""
SDK_REPLACEMENT = """# Go SDK

The public Go API for extension authors is the separate module `github.com/MichaelKinsy/PiG/extensions/sdk`. Use it to write an extension for PiG. Its import path and module boundary do not change with the host's internal layout.

PiG's agent, provider, Session, and terminal implementation packages live under `internal/`. Go prevents applications outside this repository's import tree from importing them. Use `pig --mode rpc` to control Sessions from an external application, including a Go application. Use a Piglet to compose and distribute an agent.

## Public extension module

```text
github.com/MichaelKinsy/PiG/extensions/sdk
```

The extension SDK is a nested Go module. Its release tags use the prefix `extensions/sdk/`. The command uses the root module's release tag. Pin an exact SDK release when building an extension.

See the [extension SDK reference](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/MichaelKinsy/PiG/extensions/sdk) and the extension authoring guide.

## In-repository Session integration

The following example is for code inside PiG's import tree. It is not a public embedding SDK. The internal packages can change with the host implementation.
