#!/usr/bin/env bash
# automation/ci/integration-tests.sh: split the integration suite by category so
# the long-running LLM-driven tests don't gate every commit.
#
# Categories (from AGENTS.md "Functional tests over unit tests"):
#
#   fast      : no LLM calls, deterministic. Runs in ~30s. Gate every commit.
#   parity    : side-by-side checks that still require the integration harness.
#               Canonical hermetic behavior belongs in test/parity/scenarios/.
#               Run before an upstream update or release.
#   live      : single-system live tests (TestLive_*, TestExt_Live_*,
#               TestPerf_*). Uses provider credentials. Run manually before a
#               release.
#   all       : every integration test (~25 min on a fast machine).
#
# Usage: ./automation/ci/integration-tests.sh [fast|parity|live|all] [-- extra go test flags...]
#
# Hard rules (per AGENTS.md):
#   - Never use `tmux kill-server`. Each test creates its own session by
#     PID-randomized name and kills only itself.
#   - Always use the cheap model literal: currently github-copilot/gpt-5-mini.
#     `grep -rE 'github-copilot/(gpt|claude)' test/integration/` is the
#     audit query.
