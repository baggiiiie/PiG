# Session file format

PiG stores each Session as JSON Lines. Line 1 is a Session header. Each later line is one entry in a tree.

The format follows the pinned upstream Pi Session format. PiG preserves unknown entry fields when it reads and writes a Session.

Pi 0.87.1 also writes `context_edit` entries, which change the context an earlier entry contributes. PiG does not apply them yet, so a Session that contains context edits builds a different model context in PiG than in Pi.

## File location

The default location is:

```text
~/.pig/agent/sessions/--<project-path>--/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl
```

PiG uses `PIG_CODING_AGENT_DIR` when you configure a different agent directory.

Use `/resume` to open or delete a Session. PiG uses the `trash` command for deletion when it is available.

## Header

The first line has no `id` or `parentId`:

```json
{"type":"session","version":3,"id":"session-uuid","timestamp":"2026-01-15T14:00:00Z","cwd":"/work/project"}
```

A cloned Session can also contain `parentSession`.

The current upstream Session schema version is 3. PiG migrates supported older upstream Session shapes when it loads them. Do not change the version field by hand.

## Entry tree

Every entry after the header contains:

```json
{
  "type": "message",
  "id": "a1b2c3d4",
  "parentId": null,
  "timestamp": "2026-01-15T14:00:01Z"
}
```

`parentId` points to the previous entry on that branch. A root entry uses `null`. A branch adds a new child to an earlier entry. The active leaf identifies the current branch.

Entries stay in append order in the file. Build the current conversation by walking from the active leaf to the root. Do not treat file order as one linear conversation.

## Entry types

### Message

A `message` entry contains one nested Agent message:

```json
{"type":"message","id":"a1b2c3d4","parentId":null,"timestamp":"2026-01-15T14:00:01Z","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Hello"}],"timestamp":1768485601000}}
```

Supported message roles include:

- `user`;
- `assistant`;
- `toolResult`;
- `bashExecution`;
- `custom`;
- `branchSummary`;
- `compactionSummary`.

Content blocks use Pi's field names:

- `text` with `text` and an optional `textSignature`;
- `image` with `data` (base64-encoded image bytes) and `mimeType`, such as `image/png`. There is no URL form;
- `thinking` with `thinking`, an optional `thinkingSignature`, and an optional `redacted` flag;
- `toolCall` with `id`, `name`, `arguments`, and an optional `thoughtSignature` and `namespace`.

For example, an assistant turn that calls the `read` tool stores:

```json
{"type":"toolCall","id":"call_1","name":"read","arguments":{"path":"a.txt"}}
```

Treat signatures as opaque provider data. Sessions written by older PiG versions can contain a `tool_use` block with `input` in place of `arguments`. PiG still reads that form and writes `toolCall`.

A completed assistant message can contain provider, model, API, usage, diagnostics, response identity, `stopReason`, and `errorMessage` fields. Treat fields that you do not use as opaque data.

A Bash entry uses the normal outer `message` shape. Its nested role is `bashExecution`:

```json
{"type":"message","id":"b2c3d4e5","parentId":"a1b2c3d4","timestamp":"2026-01-15T14:00:02Z","message":{"role":"bashExecution","command":"go test ./...","output":"ok","exitCode":0,"cancelled":false,"truncated":false}}
```

Optional Bash fields are `fullOutputPath` (the file that holds output too long to store inline), `timestamp` (Unix milliseconds), and `excludeFromContext` (set for a command run with `!!`, which the model does not see).

### Model change

```json
{"type":"model_change","id":"c3d4e5f6","parentId":"b2c3d4e5","timestamp":"2026-01-15T14:05:00Z","provider":"openai","modelId":"gpt-5"}
```

### Thinking-level change

```json
{"type":"thinking_level_change","id":"d4e5f6a7","parentId":"c3d4e5f6","timestamp":"2026-01-15T14:06:00Z","thinkingLevel":"high"}
```

### Compaction

```json
{"type":"compaction","id":"e5f6a7b8","parentId":"d4e5f6a7","timestamp":"2026-01-15T14:10:00Z","summary":"Earlier work summary","firstKeptEntryId":"c3d4e5f6","tokensBefore":50000}
```

Optional fields include `details`, `fromHook`, summary-generation `usage`, and `systemMessage`. `systemMessage` records the system prompt and tool declarations at the compaction boundary. It becomes the leading system message of the compacted context. Built-in `toolsAdded` parameter schemas retain Pi's declaration order, including nested properties, when saved and compacted again after loading.

PiG builds post-compaction context from the summary, `firstKeptEntryId`, and later entries. The current format does not define a `retainedTail` field.

### Branch summary

```json
{"type":"branch_summary","id":"f6a7b8c9","parentId":"a1b2c3d4","timestamp":"2026-01-15T14:15:00Z","fromId":"e5f6a7b8","summary":"Summary of the branch that was left"}
```

Optional fields include `details`, `fromHook`, and `usage`.

### Custom entry

A custom entry stores extension state. It does not become model context:

```json
{"type":"custom","id":"a7b8c9d0","parentId":"f6a7b8c9","timestamp":"2026-01-15T14:20:00Z","customType":"review-state","data":{"count":42}}
```

Use a namespaced `customType`. Treat another extension's data as opaque.

### Custom message

A custom message can participate in model context:

```json
{"type":"custom_message","id":"b8c9d0e1","parentId":"a7b8c9d0","timestamp":"2026-01-15T14:25:00Z","customType":"review-note","content":"Review the changed API.","display":true}
```

`content` can be a string or content-block array. `details` is optional.

### Label

```json
{"type":"label","id":"c9d0e1f2","parentId":"b8c9d0e1","timestamp":"2026-01-15T14:30:00Z","targetId":"a1b2c3d4","label":"checkpoint"}
```

A `null` label clears the target label.

### Session information

```json
{"type":"session_info","id":"d0e1f2a3","parentId":"c9d0e1f2","timestamp":"2026-01-15T14:35:00Z","name":"Refactor authentication"}
```

PiG shows the latest Session name in `/resume`.

## Context construction

PiG builds model context from the active root-to-leaf branch:

1. It finds the active branch.
2. It applies the latest model and thinking-level entries.
3. It applies compaction at `firstKeptEntryId`.
4. It converts message, custom-message, branch-summary, and compaction entries to model messages.
5. It excludes custom state entries and Bash entries marked `excludeFromContext`.

Do not reconstruct model context by reading every `message` line in file order.

## Read Sessions from an extension

The Go extension SDK provides:

```go
branch, err := ctx.GetBranch()      // []sdk.BranchEntry for the active branch
entries, err := ctx.GetEntries()    // []json.RawMessage for all entries
leafID, err := ctx.GetLeafID()      // *string, nil for an empty session
file, err := ctx.GetSessionFile()   // *string, nil for an in-memory session
```

`GetBranch` provides a flattened reading view for common message fields. Use `GetEntries` when you need the exact entry JSON.

PiG subscribes an extension to Session-log replication only when the extension first asks for entries. Later appends update a local SDK mirror. This avoids repeated full-history IPC and avoids copying long Sessions into extensions that never inspect them.

## Parse a file in Go

Use `json.RawMessage` so unknown fields survive your parser:

```go
file, err := os.Open("session.jsonl")
if err != nil {
    return err
}
defer file.Close()

scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)
scanner.Buffer(make([]byte, 64*1024), 128*1024*1024)
for scanner.Scan() {
    var entry struct {
        Type     string          `json:"type"`
        ID       string          `json:"id"`
        ParentID *string         `json:"parentId"`
        Message  json.RawMessage `json:"message"`
    }
    if err := json.Unmarshal(scanner.Bytes(), &entry); err != nil {
        return err
    }
    // Process known fields. Retain scanner.Bytes() for an exact copy.
}
return scanner.Err()
```

Set an explicit scanner limit. A Session line can contain a large tool result or image.

## Compatibility rules

- Preserve the header schema version.
- Preserve unknown fields and unknown entry types.
- Preserve `null` versus a missing `parentId`.
- Do not reorder entries.
- Do not rewrite timestamps or IDs.
- Do not edit a Session while PiG is writing it.
- Use the extension APIs to append extension state or messages during a running Session.
