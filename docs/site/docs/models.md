# Models

A model in PiG is identified by a **provider-qualified spec**: `provider/modelID`. Model-selection APIs such as `--model`, `/model`, `Ctrl+P` cycling, and `Context.SetModel()` use provider-qualified specs. Scoped model entries in settings also use that form. The saved default is an exception: set `defaultProvider` to the provider and `defaultModel` to the model ID without the provider prefix. A provider-qualified `defaultModel` does not select that model at startup. Bare model IDs passed to model-selection APIs are accepted for backward compatibility but can route to `openai/<id>` instead of the intended provider.

## Selecting a model

| Mechanism | Effect |
|---|---|
| `pig --model openai/gpt-5.5` | Override for this process. |
| `/model` slash command | Open the selector. Enter selects for this session. Ctrl+S selects and saves the default. |
| `Ctrl+P` / `Shift+Ctrl+P` | Cycle next/previous within scoped models. |
| `/scoped-models` | Edit the cycle list interactively. |
| `--models a,b,c` | Set scope for this run only (does not persist). |
| `setModel(spec)` (extension API) | Programmatic switch. Returns `(applied, error)`. |

The selector lists models from providers with configured authentication. It uses `GEMINI_API_KEY` for Google Gemini, not `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. Providers without configured authentication are omitted.

## Scoped models

Scoped models are the list `Ctrl+P` cycles through. They are stored in settings as provider-qualified IDs; PiG accepts legacy bare IDs and rewrites them on next save.

Cycling preserves both `provider` and `id`. The `generatedModelSpec` helper produces specs like:

- `github-copilot/gpt-5.5`
- `openai/gpt-5.5-mini`
- `openrouter/openai/gpt-5.5` - trailing slash inside `id` is preserved.

If a custom helper or extension passes only `model.ID` to `BuildModel()`, PiG falls back to `openai/<id>` - never do this in cycling code paths.

## Thinking levels

PiG surfaces reasoning effort through these named levels:

```text
off → minimal → low → medium → high → xhigh → max
```

A model exposes only the levels it supports. Cycling follows that supported set.

The Session selects and clamps the startup level before interactive mode opens. An explicit `--thinking` value takes precedence. A thinking suffix in `--model provider/model:level` also reaches the Session before interactive startup. Otherwise, a resumed Session keeps its saved level; a new Session uses the model preference, the global default, or `medium`. Unsupported levels round up to a supported level, or use the highest supported level if none is higher. The footer and editor show the Session's effective level, and provider requests use that same level through the model's thinking-level mapping. Opening interactive mode does not reset it from settings.

- `Shift+Tab` cycles thinking on models that advertise reasoning support.
- `getThinkingLevel()` and `setThinkingLevel(level)` are exposed to extensions.
- The current label is rendered in the status line; extensions can override the hidden label with `ui.setHiddenThinkingLabel`.
- Models that do not support reasoning silently ignore changes; the host does not emit an error.

A model is reasoning-capable when its generated entry sets `Reasoning: true`; `ThinkingLevelMap` controls how each level is wired into the request. See `ai/models_generated.go` in source for the table.

## Model metadata

`getAllTools()` excluded, every model entry the host knows about carries:

- `Provider` - provider key (see `providers.md`).
- `ID` - model identifier as the provider names it. May contain slashes.
- `DisplayName` - UI label.
- `Reasoning` - bool; whether the model supports `thinking_level`.
- `ThinkingLevelMap` - provider-specific wiring per level.
- `MaxTokens` / `ContextWindow` - for context usage math.
- `Cost` (if known) - input/output rates.

Extensions can read this via `getModelInfo()` (returns `*ModelInfo`) inside any handler.

## Adding a model

New built-in models are generated into `ai/models_generated.go` and committed in source. Extensions cannot add new built-in models, but they can register an independent provider and model catalog. See [Providers](/docs/latest/providers) and [Extensions](/docs/latest/extensions).

## Provider cost tiers

An extension's registered model can include `cost.tiers`. Each tier supplies `inputTokensAbove` and the `input`, `output`, `cacheRead`, and `cacheWrite` rates per million tokens. PiG retains these thresholds and rates through Provider registration and model lookup. The existing cost calculation selects the applicable tier from total input usage.

## Common errors

Model configuration read, JSON parse, and schema errors include a `File:` line that identifies the selected `models.json` path. Check that file's contents and permissions. A missing file is allowed. PiG leaves invalid files unchanged.

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `defaultModel` contains `github-copilot/gpt-6-sol`, but a new session starts on another model | The saved default expects separate provider and model fields. | Set `"defaultProvider": "github-copilot"` and `"defaultModel": "gpt-6-sol"`. |
| `model gpt-5.5 routed to openai but I selected copilot` | Bare ID passed to `BuildModel()` | Always pass `provider/id`. |
| `GPT-5.5 does not support thinking` after a binary swap | Stale `pig` on `PATH` | Reinstall or rebuild PiG, run `hash -r`, and restart the TUI. |
| Thinking cycle has no effect | Active model has `Reasoning: false` | Switch to a reasoning model. |
| Model selector empty after `pig login` | Credentials wrote to wrong root | Check `PIG_HOME` vs `~/.pig`. |
