# Terminal UI

PiG provides a Go-native terminal interface that follows the observable behavior of upstream Pi. The interactive application includes the startup header, transcript, editor, overlays, and footer.

This page describes the PiG user and extension boundary. It does not expose PiG's internal TUI packages as a stable application SDK.

## Start the TUI

Run `pig` without print or RPC mode:

```bash
pig
```

The TUI uses the current working directory, settings, model selection, trusted Resources, and active Piglet.

## Main areas

| Area | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Header | Show startup identity and operational information. |
| Transcript | Show user messages, assistant output, tools, results, notices, and extension content. |
| Editor | Accept prompts, commands, paths, and file references. |
| Footer | Show working directory, model, context, usage, and status. |
| Overlay | Own focus for selectors, settings, tree navigation, or extension UI. |

## Core interaction

- Type `/` to open command completion.
- Type `@` to search for project files.
- Press Tab to complete paths and commands.
- Press Enter to submit.
- Press Shift+Enter or Ctrl+J to insert a newline.
- Press Escape to cancel the active dialog, compaction, Bash command, or model turn.
- Press Ctrl+C to clear the editor. Press it again within 500 ms to exit.
- Press Ctrl+D on an empty editor to exit.

See [Keybindings](/docs/latest/keybindings) for the complete binding list.

## Modes

PiG supports regular and fullscreen terminal modes. Configure `tuiMode` in settings or use the corresponding interactive setting.

The TUI responds to terminal resize. It calculates width in terminal cells and preserves Unicode and ANSI rendering boundaries. Markdown horizontal rules use at most 80 content columns, including in expanded compaction summaries. Changing output padding retains user-message Markdown transforms and their pending work.

## Error notices

Provider errors appear in the assistant response without a second `Provider request failed` status. After a non-retryable assistant error, PiG shows a `/bug` hint once during the interactive run. Aborted or cancelled requests do not trigger the hint. See [Slash commands](/docs/latest/slash-commands) for the `/bug` report workflow and its D62 delivery difference.

Markdown wraps long unbroken text without truncating it. Link detection scans each word once so long text does not trigger repeated searches through the same suffix.

## Extension UI

Extensions can contribute:

- notifications;
- status entries;
- widgets;
- headers and typed login identity;
- message and entry renderers;
- focused custom components;
- terminal input handlers;
- theme changes.

Source extensions send bounded serializable state through the extension host. PiG keeps socket and JSON work off the TUI render loop and renders from local cached state.

## Focused custom components

A focused component owns keyboard input until it completes or is cancelled.

For subprocess extensions:

1. the extension builds and renders the component locally;
2. PiG waits for exclusive terminal focus without blocking the TUI loop;
3. PiG opens a native focus-owning shell;
4. the extension sends replaceable line snapshots;
5. PiG sends ordered input to the extension;
6. the host rejects stale-width, out-of-order, or late frames;
7. close, cancellation, reload, disconnect, or shutdown stops the worker;
8. the SDK detaches invalidation before it disposes the component.

PiG suppresses identical frames. The host render path reads only the latest completed local frame.

## Timer-driven components

Go, Rust, Python, and Node custom components can request a new frame after timer-owned state changes. PiG coalesces requests, limits timer frames to the 16 ms TUI interval, and preserves immediate input frames.

PiG Standard uses this public contract for PiG Runner. The Runner is an ordinary fused Go extension. Stock PiG has no Runner-specific callback or launcher.

## Login and header identity

Stock PiG uses a product-neutral text header. An extension can set a validated native login definition through the shared header slot.

PiG Standard's `piglogin` extension uses this contract. It owns the Standard artwork and `/sprite` command. Stock PiG does not import that Resource.

Preview one login extension without starting a model Session:

```bash
pig extension preview-login ./my-login-extension
```

## Themes

Use `/settings` to select the active theme. PiG can load additional theme Resources from trusted user, project, Package, and Piglet sources.

See [Themes](/docs/latest/themes).

## Rendering failures

A renderer generation has a bounded inactivity contract. If it stalls, PiG cancels that generation and keeps the last valid frame.

A failed extension must not perform blocking IPC on the TUI render loop. Connection failure closes state owned by that extension and leaves unrelated UI available where possible.

## Accessibility and terminal behavior

PiG supports keyboard operation for its interactive surfaces. Theme and extension authors must preserve readable contrast, focus indication, terminal-cell width, and reduced-motion expectations.

Use a supported terminal and verify behavior at narrow and wide widths. See [Terminal setup](/docs/latest/terminal-setup).

## Upstream distinction

The package `@earendil-works/pi-tui` is the TypeScript TUI package for upstream Pi. It is not PiG's Go API.

Use the [upstream TUI documentation](https://pi.dev/docs/latest/tui) when you are writing an in-process TypeScript extension for Pi itself.
