# Quickstart

PiG is under active development. Install it on macOS or Linux with `curl -fsSL https://pi-in-go.dev/install.sh | sh`, on any supported platform with `npm install -g @pi-in-go/pig` or `go install github.com/MichaelKinsy/PiG/cmd/pig@latest`, or download an archive from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/MichaelKinsy/PiG/releases). Windows support is a preview. To build from source instead, follow the steps below.

## Requirements

Build the `pig` executable with Go 1.27.1. Go 1.27 release binaries for
macOS require macOS 13 or later.

The complete verification suite also uses:

- Git;
- Node.js 24.19.0 and npm 12.1.0;
- Python 3.12;
- Rust 1.97.1;
- tmux on Unix.

You do not need every verification tool to run a previously built executable.

## Build from source

Clone the repository and build PiG:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MichaelKinsy/PiG.git
cd PiG
go build -o bin/pig ./cmd/pig
./bin/pig --version
```

Do not install PiG by running an upstream Pi npm command. The package `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` installs Pi, not PiG.

## Install with npm

Install the command with npm (Node.js 18 or newer):

```bash
npm install -g @pi-in-go/pig
pig --version
```

Or run it once without installing:

```bash
npx @pi-in-go/pig --version
```

`pig` itself is the native binary: npm installs the matching platform package
(`@pi-in-go/pig-<os>-<cpu>`, for macOS, Linux and Windows on x64 and arm64) as
an optional dependency, and Node.js runs only a small launcher. Do not install
with `--omit=optional` or `--no-optional`, which leaves the binary out. Update
with `npm update -g @pi-in-go/pig` and uninstall with
`npm uninstall -g @pi-in-go/pig`. `pig update` does not replace an
npm-installed binary; update through npm.

## Install with Go

Go 1.26 or newer installs the command without cloning the repository:

```bash
go install github.com/MichaelKinsy/PiG/cmd/pig@latest
```

Use an exact version for a reproducible installation:

```bash
go install github.com/MichaelKinsy/PiG/cmd/pig@v0.2.0
```

Go writes the `pig` executable to `GOBIN`. When `GOBIN` is empty, Go uses the
`bin` directory below the first path in `GOPATH`: `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`, which
is `~/go/bin` by default (`%USERPROFILE%\go\bin` on Windows). With an older Go
1.21 or later and the default `GOTOOLCHAIN=auto`, Go downloads a new enough
toolchain automatically. Add that directory to `PATH`, then inspect the
installed module identity:

```bash
pig version
go version -m "$(command -v pig)"
```

Update a Go installation by running `go install` again with a newer exact
version or with `@latest`. PiG does not treat a Go-installed executable as a
standalone release download, so `pig update` refuses to replace it without a
matching installation receipt.

Explicit `pig update` version checks retry transient transport failures and transient HTTP statuses at most twice within one ten-second budget. Startup checks do not retry. Signature and manifest errors stop the update. Native standalone updates reject concurrent replacement of the same executable and hold the installation lock until receipt commit or rollback completes (D39). The `<executable>.update.lock` sidecar remains on disk; do not delete it while an update runs.

Each release tags the root module (`v0.2.0`) and the nested Go extension SDK
module (`extensions/sdk/v0.2.0`) on the same commit; `go install` needs both.

## Start PiG

Run PiG in the project you want it to inspect:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
/path/to/PiG/bin/pig
```

PiG stores user state below `~/.pig`. Use `PIG_HOME` only when you need an isolated configuration root.

## Authenticate a provider

List login targets available in the current binary:

```bash
pig login --list
```

Start an available OAuth login:

```bash
pig login github-copilot
```

For an API-key provider, set the provider's documented environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
pig --model openai/gpt-4.1
```

Use `pig --help` and `pig login --help` as the authority for your binary.

## Start a first session

Type a request and press Enter:

```text
Summarize this repository and tell me how to run its checks.
```

Stock PiG gives the model its normal built-in coding tools unless the command line, settings, or an active Piglet narrows them.

## Use print mode

Run one prompt without the interactive TUI:

```bash
pig -p "Summarize this repository"
```

Select a model explicitly when needed:

```bash
pig --model github-copilot/gpt-5-mini -p "Find the test entry points"
```

## Run PiG Standard

PiG Standard is not part of bare Stock PiG startup. Select it explicitly from a source checkout:

```bash
pig --piglet piglets/standard/pig-standard.yaml
```

The current Standard composition provides its PiG login, `/sprite`, `/runner`, and `/pig-runner` through ordinary extension Resources.

## Run your own Piglet

Validate and run one agent application:

```bash
pig piglet validate ./agents/reviewer.yaml
pig --piglet ./agents/reviewer.yaml
```

Register portable Piglet source when you want to invoke it by name:

```bash
pig piglet add ./agents/reviewer.yaml
pig --piglet reviewer
```

See [Piglets](/docs/latest/piglets).

## Build a Piglet Binary

```bash
pig piglet build ./agents/reviewer.yaml \
  --format binary \
  --out ./pig-reviewer
./pig-reviewer
```

A Piglet Binary is a target-native executable for one fixed Piglet composition. It can still have explicit external requirements. See [Piglet Binaries](/docs/latest/piglet-binaries).

## Add an extension

Create and validate a Go factory:

```bash
pig extension init ./review --lang go
pig install ./review --validate-only --json
```

Run it for one session:

```bash
pig -e ./review
```

Use a Piglet when the extension belongs to a named agent application.

## Verify a source checkout

Prepare the exact Pi comparator and source mirror:

```bash
make upstream-mirror
```

Run the primary gate:

```bash
make check
```

Use the toolchain versions declared by the repository. A green build does not replace parity review, vulnerability review, artifact inventory, or release authorization.
