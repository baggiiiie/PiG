# 0.3.x release-gate and review known gaps

Release-policy source snapshot: `f4cfefc2e4dd3841a8d8597dad5826f858fc4c1a`, Pi 0.87.1. Review/SDK receipts and their earlier verification below remain qualified against `6f400400610b433c3e5ac56b132a25e779588a4b`; this merge-queue accounting update does not re-certify them on the newer source. No `FREEZE <sha>` notification exists when this update is prepared. Reconcile both inventories on the exact frozen commit before release.

## Owner decision and limits

Owner Michael Kinsy approves this accounting exception on 2026-09-28 under task `ledger-gaps-030`. It permits explicit 0.3.x known-gap records for the remaining release-gate rows and unfinished confirmed review findings. It does not claim parity, change runtime behavior, waive test assertions, or authorize publication. The earlier [D78/RPC33/event-bus decision](../findings/0.3.0-known-gaps.md) and its same-process limits remain in force. Existing numbered divergences retain their exact scope; this ledger does not silently expand them.

Only `make test-porting-release` accepts the reviewed deferral tag. Unit tests, paired scenarios, strict mapping and all other gates retain their assertions. See the [release-policy procedure](../../test/parity/README.md#approved-03x-test-porting-gaps). The missing-case descriptions in the mapping are acceptance obligations, not proof that implementation is absent; some ports exist only in separate candidate commits or lack full caller/live/platform qualification.

## Reviewed test closures on 4bd167229

The promotion audit on integration `4bd167229` closes 18 of the original 65 test-porting gaps. Every newly cited Go test passes with `-count=1` under isolated HOME and agent directories on that source. The audit compares each original case's inputs and assertions with the integrated tests and preserves every upstream hash. These rows now have `ported` mappings. Their obsolete `deferred-0.3.x` tags are removed, and their original production-path rationales are restored. Every `hot-path` tag and the committed baseline remain unchanged.

The [reviewed mapping](../../test/parity/interfaces/test-mapping-v0.87.1.json), after the accepted Windows/WSL aggregate and CLI/SDK ports, records 505 ported files. There are 10 approved hot-path gaps remaining: 0 CLI, 2 extension, 1 provider, 3 Session and 4 TUI rows. The other 15 partial/pending files retain their non-hot-path classification. These totals describe the merged mapping; the source-specific verification receipts below retain their original snapshot identities. No confirmed review finding or SDK-consistency group is closed by test-file accounting alone.

## Original upstream test-porting gap snapshot

The initial gate reported 66 findings on `6f4004006`. Integration `f4cfefc2e` already marks `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/regressions/6260-inline-extension-naming.test.ts` ported, so its obsolete deferral is removed and its original production-path rationale is restored. Its `hot-path` tag and reviewed mapping remain unchanged. The 0.3.0 release branch closes `packages/coding-agent/test/mermaid.test.ts`: `TestMermaidRenderingUpstream` ports all 8 upstream cases, so its deferral is removed and its hot-path tag is kept. The remaining 64 deferred rows retain their partial/pending dispositions and explicit approved rationale/follow-up. The baseline stays at 319 ported paths. They were ported at staging commit `c582a1606e598587cdfa0bab8a031764cdc4c705`, which is not in public history, because the release is one squashed commit. The policy therefore anchors on public main `f5c98329d959932142ecfe2a819ab589c4ecb865`: the stored 319-path list must keep that commit's 119 ported paths, and the gate still requires at least 319 ported files. The integration mapping reports 450 ported files; this update promotes none.

| Area / follow-up | Rows |
|---|---:|
| `cli` / `FOLLOWUP-cli` | 4 |
| `extensions` / `FOLLOWUP-extensions` | 3 |
| `providers` / `FOLLOWUP-providers` | 20 |
| `sessions` / `FOLLOWUP-sessions` | 11 |
| `tui` / `FOLLOWUP-tui` | 26 |

The complete missing cases are the unchanged `rationale` of each exact upstream path in the [test mapping](../../test/parity/interfaces/test-mapping-v0.87.1.json). The [release policy](../../test/parity/interfaces/test-porting-policy-v0.87.1.json) binds each approval to that path and its upstream SHA-256. The gate prints the full missing-case description on every successful accounting run. The case-site column is the compiler-derived file denominator, not the number of missing tests or a runtime expansion count.

There are also 15 partial/pending files without a hot-path tag. They keep their existing non-release-blocking policy classification and receive no deferral in this change. The tracking issue draft lists them separately so the complete 80-file open test denominator remains visible.

## Unfinished confirmed review findings

The queue snapshot contains 67 `REVIEW-*` rows with confirmed receipts. Two findings are closed on this exact source by fresh existing regression runs: `REVIEW-CLIEXT-001` (`TestStdoutCleanlinessUpstream`) and `REVIEW-RP-006` (`TestDirectSimpleAnthropicSelectedModel`). Both pass in `closed-review-check.log`. The remaining 66 rows below are not credited as fixed by a separate lane's unintegrated or unqualified checkpoint. Five rows are duplicate receipts and point to their canonical follow-up rather than five new bugs.

Locations identify the reviewer's cited source snapshot. A WIP hash in a location is not a Git commit or evidence that the patch is integrated. These are open closure obligations; where the finding concerns an unmerged candidate or test strength, it is not a claim of a newly reproduced production failure on this source snapshot. The full original and independent confirmation receipts, including upstream paths and repros, are retained with the issue drafts. REFUTED and UNCLEAR findings are not silently relabeled CONFIRMED.

In PiG only skill conflicts go through `showLoadedResources`; prompt conflicts are raw path/message lines appended to the chat after Extension issues, startup Extension issues list subprocess load errors only, command and shortcut diagnostics appear only in the `/reload` summary, and built-in slash-command and theme conflicts have no producer. | internal/codingagent/loaded_resources.go:69-199; internal/codingagent/prompt_diagnostics.go:16-31; internal/codingagent/interactive.go:1550-1569; internal/codingagent/interactive_commands.go:934-945 (upstream interactive-mode.ts:1854-1905) | `FOLLOWUP-TUIA-001` |

## Three open SDK-consistency groups

These are SC10, SC11 and SC13 from the `sdk-consistency` handoff. SC12 (`constrainedSampling: false`, including the transcript tool declaration) and SC14 (explicit empty or null provider-owned credential keys) are closed. The rows below state only what remains after the SC10, SC11 and SC13 pass. Severity is assigned here for follow-up triage; SC13 is an audit, not a claim that every member has a new failing reproduction.

| Group | Severity | User impact | File:line | Follow-up |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `SC10` | medium | The host-backed `Context` getters, `GetBranch` and `GetEntries` return an error or raise on a host failure and distinguish Pi's `undefined` from an empty value in Go, Rust and Python. Still open: (a) the subprocess host does not implement Pi's stale-context rejection (`runner.ts:680-690`; only `coding/extension/host/inproc` has it), so no conformance row can trigger a real-bridge getter failure without a test-only hook and failure surfacing is proven by each SDK's mock-host tests only; (b) print, JSON and RPC modes now bind `getThinkingLevel`, `getContextUsage` and `getSystemPromptOptions` to the Session, but `getModelInfo` was not re-audited there; (c) the in-process `extension.API.GetSessionName` still returns `""` for Pi's `undefined`; (d) the SDKs disagree on malformed replies (Go and Python treat a missing required field as an error, Rust returns `Ok(None)` for a missing usage or model result). | coding/extension/host/subprocess/ui_bridge.go (host call dispatch); coding/extension/api.go:311-314; extensions/sdk-rs/src/context.rs (`get_context_usage`, `get_model_info`) | `FOLLOWUP-sdk-SC10` |
| `SC11` | medium | Exec and dialog timeouts carry Pi's JavaScript number through every SDK, the host exec path and the RPC dialog request, and `getSystemPromptOptions` has Pi's collection-complete shape. Still open: (a) the Session path's `before_agent_start` and `getSystemPromptOptions` values differ from Pi: `customPrompt` holds the whole rendered prompt, and `toolSnippets`, `toolGuidelines`, `contextFiles` and `skills` are empty (`coding/session_prompt.go:79-87`), and the host has no `forceSystemPrompt` field; (b) a tool's `promptGuidelines: []` collapses to an omitted key in `getAllTools` (four host layers use `omitempty`); (c) Go overlay `MinWidth`, `OffsetX` and `OffsetY` and the host's remote-overlay decoder are integer carriers; (d) `Infinity` and `NaN` timeouts fail differently per SDK (Go marshal error, Rust `null`, Python `Infinity` token), while Pi treats `Infinity` as a 1 ms timer; (e) the optional message and overlay field audit is incomplete. | coding/session_prompt.go:79-87; coding/extension/tool.go:91,115; coding/extension/host/subprocess/protocol.go:176; extensions/sdk/context.go (`OverlayOptions`); coding/extension/remote_overlay.go:41-44 | `FOLLOWUP-sdk-SC11` |
| `SC13` | high | Audited across Go, Rust, Python and TypeScript (declaration-only, Node runtime). Native SDKs still lack the event bus, `withSession`/`setup` replacement callbacks, a native editor factory and `provider.streamSimple`, `refreshModels` and `oauth.modifyModels` callbacks. Each needs a host-to-extension callback or relay in `protocol.go`, host wiring, all four SDKs and an approved spec (D77, D78, D83). Nothing was closed in this pass. Across the four runtimes only `pi.events` (Node implemented; Go, Rust and Python missing), `ctx.ui.getEditorComponent` (Node and Go stand-ins; Rust and Python missing), `ctx.ui.custom(options.onHandle)` and `tool render context.lastComponent` (Node stand-ins; native missing) differ; the replacement and provider callbacks are missing in all four. | docs/extension-sdk-surface.md:176,1013,1118; extensions/sdk/provider_proxy.go:46 | `FOLLOWUP-sdk-SC13` |

## Merge-queue verification on f4cfefc2e

The unchanged gate rejects the stale 6260 deferral before this update. After removal, `make test-porting-release` passes and prints 65 approved known gaps, 598 reviewed paths, 450 ported and the unchanged baseline of 319. The closed row's mapping cites `TestNodeInlineExtensionNamingUpstream` and `coding/extension/host/subprocess/testdata/inline-naming.mjs` for Pi's four cases at lines 36, 56, 79 and 99; this accounting update changes neither the evidence nor its assertions.

`make ci-contracts` stops at `interface-go-drift` because the integration's `test/parity/interfaces/pig-go.json` is stale. `make -k ci-contracts` confirms that this is the only failing prerequisite; the release gate and all remaining prerequisites pass. This is an integration-generated-inventory failure, not a test-porting deferral. Focused gate and coverage tests pass under `-race -count=1`. `make coverage RESULTS=` regenerates current accounting, including the integration's already-changed PORT_MAP and scenario denominator; it does not claim fresh scenario runs. No failure is absorbed by the known-gap tag.

## Earlier verification and follow-up ownership

The checks below belong to the original `6f4004006` ledger change. They are not fresh results for the merge-queue source above.

- `make test-porting-release`: before the policy change, fails on all recorded rows; after, passes and prints the approved known-gap count. This result proves explicit accounting only.
- `make -k ci-contracts`: passes on the reviewed source plus this policy change. No other-lane failure is observed in this run.
- `go test -race ./test/parity/cmd/testinventorycheck ./test/parity/cmd/coverage -count=1`: passes. Deferral tests preserve mappings and reject invalid/stale approvals, hash drift, unlisted hot paths, strict-mode closure bypass and baseline regressions.
- Four compiling gate mutations fail their distinguishing tests: remove deferral support, ignore approval validation, ignore the baseline, or omit the visible count. Logs are under `mutations/` in the evidence root.
- `make ci-drift RESULTS=`, full `make lint`, native `go vet ./...`, Windows vet for the gate package and focused `go fix -diff` pass. `make lint-changed` cannot find a merge base with `main`; full and targeted lint pass instead. No suppression or environment workaround changes this result.
- The existing tests and comparators are unchanged. No mapping or PORT_MAP status is promoted. No new performance or resource-lifetime claim is made.
- `make coverage RESULTS=` regenerates only current ledger accounting, without importing unrelated shared parity results as runs of this snapshot.
