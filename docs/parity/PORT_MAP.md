# PORT_MAP

Minimal upstream to pig file map.

- `docs/parity/PORT_MAP.md` answers where code lives
- `test/parity/coverage.md` answers what is verified and at what quality
- status here means code mapping only, not parity proof

Status: `✅` ported, `🟡` partial, `⬜` not started, `⏸` deferred, `🔴` broken, `n/a` not applicable.

Verification quality is tracked by the parity system, not by this status column. A row can be `✅` and still weak-only or untested in `test/parity/coverage.md`. Boot-only, smoke-only, and deferred scenarios do not count as behavioral verification. Registration-only scenarios count only for registry/catalog/auth-wiring paths. Provider implementation rows (for example `providers/openai-completions.ts`, `providers/openai-responses*.ts`, `providers/transform-messages.ts`) require stream/payload/history behavior tests; `--list-models` can only cover registry/catalog wiring.

## Version and gates

`internal/coding/pigversion/pigversion.go` is the sole version pin; `coding/upstream.go` re-exports it as `coding.UpstreamVersion` and `coding.UpstreamCommit`. `test/upstream-parity/mirror_version_test.go` rejects a `.upstream/current` mirror with a different package version. This map intentionally does not copy the version number.

`make port-map-drift` rejects source files missing from the map and any row, whatever its status, whose upstream file disappeared. `make upstream-delta` rejects changed source files without an explicit disposition and durable evidence. `make async-contracts` rejects Promise/async source files without a reviewed ordering, cancellation, error, concurrency, and loop-ownership contract. `make coverage-strict` rejects partial, broken, not-started, weak-only, and untested intended ports. `make family-gaps STRICT=1` rejects intended ports with no behavior family and family entries without acceptable behavioral evidence. `make foundation-check` runs those completeness gates after the normal parity gate.

Release history and open work belong in the tracked sync plan and generated coverage report, not this map.

## Package scope

The current PiG coding-agent release scope covers upstream `packages/agent`,
`packages/ai`, `packages/coding-agent`, and `packages/tui`. The sections below
map every tracked source file in those packages.

The following upstream monorepo packages are outside this four-package file
denominator. PiG now contains experimental adapters and selected shared
primitives from some of them; their presence does not establish complete package
parity or add their files to the percentage:

- `packages/client`, `packages/protocol`, `packages/server`, and
  `packages/session-backends` implement the experimental remote Session stack;
- `packages/chord` is an independent application-composition runtime; selected context/service implementations exist, but this denominator does not certify its complete plugin, replicated-state, RPC, or bundler surface;
- `packages/durable` currently publishes the detached Pico runtime and records the unimplemented Pico5 design. PiG tracks the active coding-agent Session behavior instead;
- `packages/telemetry` provides the standalone telemetry library;
- `packages/evals` provides upstream evaluation tooling.

Their omission is a metric scope boundary, not evidence of absence or complete
implementation. Add a package to the interface denominator and map all of its
source files before including it in a package-wide completeness claim.

The drift gate also rejects explicit production comments claiming to port an
upstream file while its row remains not-started, deferred, or n/a. Such conflicts
require reviewed mappings; code presence alone never automatically earns ✅.

**Windows port: windows/amd64 implementation mapping.** The following entries identify platform-specific code. They do not establish native execution or full Windows parity:
- `ai/auth.go`: auth.json lock via `LockFileEx`/`UnlockFileEx` (upstream `flock` equivalent).
- `tui/terminal.go`: raw mode over `CONIN$`/`CONOUT$`; ANSI via
  `ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING | DISABLE_NEWLINE_AUTO_RETURN`; terminal resize by polling
  `GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo` (a pig-internal mechanism under upstream's observable resize→re-render;
  windows has no SIGWINCH); `DrainInput` is a documented no-op.
- `internal/codingagent/interactive.go`: SIGHUP not registered (Go maps console-close to SIGTERM);
  resize watcher polls; Ctrl+Z suspend shows upstream's "not supported" status.
- `internal/codingagent/keybindings.go`: `ctrl+z` unbound on windows (upstream
  `win32 ? [] : "ctrl+z"`).
- `internal/codingagent/tools/bash_executor.go`: process-tree kill via `taskkill /F /T`
  (upstream `killProcessTree`).
- `internal/codingagent/tools/shell_config.go`: windows bash resolution: Git Bash at
  `%ProgramFiles%\Git\bin\bash.exe` (then x86), then `bash.exe` on PATH, else a helpful
  "install Git for Windows" error (upstream `getShellConfig` win32 branch).
- `coding/extension/exec.go`: `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` for detach.

The tmux scenario harness cannot drive a Windows `.exe`. Windows verification requires tests executed on Windows for auth locking, terminal start/stop and resize, keybindings, local-socket extension hosting, and child-process cancellation, plus an interactive pass covering render, input, resize, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z, and clean exit. Cross-compilation proves build compatibility only. Record native execution evidence against the tested commit; this map does not assert that those checks have passed. Unix scenarios cover only their exercised shared behavior.
