# DIVERGENCES

Only user visible or interop relevant differences from upstream belong here.

Do not log:

- mechanical TS to Go translation
- test harness differences
- multi language SDK surface differences over the same wire protocol

Every active divergence must have:

- id `D<N>`
- `// pig divergence (D<N>): ...` at each call site
- parity coverage or an explicit parity allowance
- `SCRUTINIZED:approved`

## Retired divergences

- D35 — Hidden `/arminsayshi` and `/dementedelves` commands. Retired by the Pi 0.87.1 component ports. `TestArminFramesMatchPinnedPi` compares every frame of all seven effects, and `TestEarendilAnnouncementMatchesPinnedPi` compares styled announcement rows. The `slash-commands/12-earendil-announcement` and `13-armin-bitmap` scenarios compare exact terminal output. The ID remains reserved.
- D50 — Extra unsupported/oversized Mermaid hints. Retired under the lead's parity-completion authority. Pi 0.87.1 `mermaid.ts:76-77` preserves the raw code block; partial-parse warnings remain display-only. `TestMermaidUnsupportedAndOversizedRemainSource`, `TestMermaidFallbackAssistantBlockMatchesDisabledTransform`, and the now byte-exact `TestMermaidTransformMatchesUpstream` verify the contract. The ID remains reserved.
- D58 — Automatic Mermaid label narrowing. Retired under the same authority. The transformer uses the natural layout and preserves source when it is too wide. The caller-free fitting search and its private bookkeeping are removed. The oversized transformer/caller cases retain the wide diagram input, and the natural engine corpus remains unchanged. The ID remains reserved.

- D47 — Width stripping consumes DEC private-mode set/reset sequences. Retired by the width-parity change. `tui/widthx.ExtractAnsi` now delegates to the upstream-compatible `ExtractAnsiCode`; the ID remains reserved. `TestExtractAnsi_PrivateModeMatchesUpstream` and `TestPiWidthDifferential` verify the shared ANSI parsing behavior. No active divergence or source marker remains.
- D71 — Nonfatal main-screen overflow recovery. Withdrawn on 2026-09-25 by owner decision; the ID remains reserved. PiG now matches upstream `tui-main-screen.ts`: an over-wide non-image row that reaches the differential-render loop writes the TUI crash log (`pi-tui-crash.log` in the configured agent directory, or the OS temp directory when none is configured), stops the TUI, and ends the process through the uncaught-exception path with status 1. Initial, full, and resize renders emit the row unchanged. Tests: `tui/render_overflow_test.go` and parity scenario `extensions-runtime/20-differential-render-overflow-terminates.toml`. No active divergence or source marker remains.

- D76 — Untransformed Markdown before an extension reply. Retired by the off-loop transform-generation path. The complete ordered chain finishes before new Markdown content is painted. Each component retains at most one active and one replaceable pending generation; cancellation and stale-result rejection keep replacements from publishing late. Tests: `TestMarkdownTransformFirstPaintWaitsForWholeChain`, `TestAsyncMarkdownReplacesPendingGeneration`, `TestAsyncMarkdownOwnerCancellationDrains`, and `extensions-runtime/33-markdown-transformer`. D56 still governs failed or stalled subprocess rendering.

- D54 — Fenced-code wrapping. Retired after re-probing Pi 0.87.1: `Markdown.render` already wraps every non-image rendered row, including code rows. PiG now uses that same final content-width pass and its continuation breakpoints. The ID remains reserved. Evidence: `tui/markdown_upstream_test.go`, `tui/markdown_codeblock_wrap_test.go`, and `test/parity/scenarios/tui-components/16-markdown-user-components.toml`.

## Active divergences (31)

D78, D82 and D83 record owner-approved known gaps for 0.3.x (decision 2026-09-28). Approval records a difference; it does not prove parity, waive an unrelated defect, or turn a failing comparison into a pass. Same-process object behavior must remain Pi-exact. See `docs/findings/0.3.0-known-gaps.md` for the integration boundary and retained failures.

## D2 PiG uses a separate command and configuration identity

What: the command, startup banner, and terminal title use `pig`. Configuration defaults to `~/.pig` and project `.pig`. A binary resolved under the name `pi` exits with status 2 instead of shadowing Pi.

The exact environment value `PIG_USE_PI_DIRS=1` explicitly selects Pi's agent and project directories. Shared mode uses `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` or `~/.pi/agent`, project `<cwd>/.pi`, and `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` rather than the two `PIG_CODING_AGENT_*` overrides. `--session-dir` and the `sessionDir` setting keep Pi's precedence. Project trust, Package/resource discovery, system prompt files, sessions, and imported Node configuration helpers all use the selected directories. PiG-owned SDK caches, docs and user Piglet state keep the PiG configuration root. No files are copied, no trees are merged, and no setting inside a relocated directory controls the selection.

Owner decision: 2026-09-27, release 0.3.0. Pi's config.ts:528-573 selects its directory identity before loading settings; a process-level opt-in avoids circular settings resolution. `PIG_CODING_AGENT_DIR=~/.pi/agent` alone remains an agent-only relocation and does not select project `.pi` or configure external adapters.

Shared auth/settings/trust and dynamic catalog cache writes use Pi's lock-directory protocol. Auth JSON preserves provider fields and required empty OAuth fields; existing auth modes and ACLs remain intact. PiG reads but does not write models.json. Session JSONL is interoperable, but simultaneous edits of one session are not supported by either host. pi-acp owns `~/.pi/pi-acp/session-map.json`; PiG does not rewrite it. Use one adapter process per home and Pi-compatible resources in shared settings. This opt-in does not make Piglets or native PiG extensions loadable by Pi.

Evidence: `TestPiDirectoriesOptIn`, `TestPiDirectoriesProjectSettingsAndSessions`, `TestPiDirectoriesSessionOverridePrecedence`, `TestPiSharedFilesRoundTrip`, `TestPiSharedFilesConcurrentWriters`, and `settings/10-pi-directories-opt-in`. The real Powerline and pi-acp replay and file-lock limits are recorded in `docs/findings/pi-directories-opt-in.md`.

Why: separate command and configuration identities prevent accidental writes to
Pi state.

Remove when: never.

The trust prompt and warning name the selected project directory and the `pig` command. Their wording, styling, and conditions otherwise match Pi. `test/parity/scenarios/project-trust/09-cancel-trust-shows-warning-with-extensions-off.toml` and `10-startup-trust-prompt-wording.toml` compare these surfaces with only the D2 identity substitution.

The built-in header follows Pi's compact and expanded help layout. Only the logo and onboarding product name use PiG's identity; config/bin/cwd reports and a separate readiness paragraph are not part of this exception.

## D14 tools-manager archive extraction uses Go stdlib instead of spawning tar/unzip/PowerShell

Upstream `tools-manager.ts` (`extractTarGzArchive`, `extractZipArchive`)
spawns `tar`, `unzip`, and (on Windows) PowerShell `Expand-Archive` to
unpack downloaded fd/rg release assets. Each platform has a fallback chain:
Linux/macOS try `unzip` then `tar`; Windows tries `tar.exe` (bsdtar) then
PowerShell.

pig `internal/codingagent/tools/tools_manager.go` uses Go stdlib
(`archive/tar` + `compress/gzip` + `archive/zip`) on all platforms. The
extracted binary is byte-identical for every fd/rg release asset published
to date; only two observable differences exist:

1. Error message text on extraction failure. Upstream produces e.g.
   `Failed to extract X: unzip: ...; tar: ...`. pig produces e.g.
   `Failed to extract X: <go-error>`. There is no parity scenario for the
   failure path (it requires a malformed archive on the GitHub CDN).

2. Symlink and hardlink handling. Upstream `tar xzf` preserves them on
   Unix. pig silently skips `TypeSymlink`/`TypeLink` entries. fd and rg
   archives contain manpage symlinks (`man/man1/fd.1` → `fd.1`) that
   neither binary actually needs; pig's behavior is therefore safe in
   practice but theoretically observable if a user `ls`-es the install
   dir.

Why this is a divergence (not a bug): the Go stdlib path is more reliable
than spawning system tools: it doesn't depend on `unzip` being installed
(Alpine, minimal Docker, Termux), can't be tricked by a hostile `tar` on
PATH, and produces deterministic error text regardless of locale. The
divergence is structural to the Go port: faithfully calling `os/exec.Command("unzip", ...)` would re-introduce the very brittleness Go's stdlib lets us
avoid.

Remove when: upstream uses an equivalent in-process archive reader, or PiG uses
the same external extraction contract.

## D26 Provider attribution headers are pig-branded

What: upstream's `mergeProviderAttributionHeaders` (provider-attribution.ts)
sends telemetry-gated attribution headers for OpenRouter
(`HTTP-Referer: https://pi.dev`, `X-OpenRouter-Title: pi`,
`X-OpenRouter-Categories: cli-agent`), NVIDIA NIM
(`X-BILLING-INVOKE-ORIGIN: Pi`), and Cloudflare (`User-Agent: pi-coding-agent`),
plus an always-on OpenCode session-correlation pair
(`x-opencode-session: <id>`, `x-opencode-client: pi`) that upstream's
`getSessionHeaders` emits regardless of the telemetry gate. pig's
`mergeProviderAttributionHeaders` (`coding/model.go`) matches that shape
file-for-file with pig branding substituted for every pi-branded value:
OpenRouter gets `HTTP-Referer: https://github.com/MichaelKinsy/PiG`,
`X-OpenRouter-Title: PiG`, `X-OpenRouter-Categories: cli-agent`; NVIDIA gets
`X-BILLING-INVOKE-ORIGIN: PiG`; Cloudflare gets `User-Agent: pig-coding-agent`;
OpenCode gets `x-opencode-client: pig` (still unconditional on telemetry, only
gated on a session ID being present, matching upstream). The OpenRouter/
NVIDIA/Cloudflare headers are gated on
`SettingsManager.IsInstallTelemetryEnabled()`, matching upstream's
`getDefaultAttributionHeaders` telemetry gate exactly.

Why: every upstream attribution value is pi-branded (`pi.dev`,
`X-OpenRouter-Title: pi`, `X-BILLING-INVOKE-ORIGIN: Pi`, `pi-coding-agent`,
`x-opencode-client: pi`). A rebranded port must not misattribute its traffic
as pi, so pig substitutes pig branding host-for-host and header-for-header
instead of narrowing upstream's provider set. Only the literal string values
change; the provider/host matching, the telemetry gate, and the
always-on OpenCode session pair are unchanged from upstream.

`IsInstallTelemetryEnabled` mirrors upstream `isInstallTelemetryEnabled`
(telemetry.ts:8): `PI_TELEMETRY` env truthiness wins when set, otherwise the
`enableInstallTelemetry` setting (default true). This is the same gate that
also covers the install/update ping, sent to PiG's own `pi-in-go.dev`
endpoint instead of pi.dev (D64; `internal/codingagent/install_telemetry.go`).

Remove when: pig sends byte-identical (unbranded) attribution headers to
upstream, which would require pig to claim it is pi — not planned.

Call-site markers:

  OpenCode session pair in `mergeProviderAttributionHeaders`

## D27 Word segmentation always uses ICU's warm dictionary-engine cache

What: PiG's word segmenter always behaves like an ICU process whose `CjkBreakEngine` is already loaded. In a fresh Pi process that has not yet built a CJK dictionary span, a span starting at U+30FC (`ー`) or U+FF70 (`ｰ`) goes to ICU's `UnhandledEngine` instead. For example, Pi 0.87.1 in a fresh Node process returns 0 for `findWordBackward("ー你好", 3)`. After any earlier Han or Kana span in the same process, or on a later call, it returns 1. PiG always returns 1.

Why: ICU's `ICULanguageBreakFactory::getEngineFor` (`brkeng.cpp`) caches break engines for the whole process, so Pi's result depends on what anything in its Node process, including in-process extensions that call `Intl.Segmenter`, segmented earlier. Emulating that needs process-global mutable segmenter state whose value PiG cannot observe from Pi's process history. PiG models the per-iterator engine stack (`rbbi.cpp`) and uses the stable warm-cache result.

Observable effect: only the first cold-cache segmentation of a dictionary span that starts at U+30FC or U+FF70 in a fresh Pi process. Every warm-process result, and the Thai, Lao, Khmer and Burmese dictionary engines, match Pi.

Scope: this records only the process-history residual. The ICU 78.3 Southeast Asian engines, `PossibleWord` lookahead and resynchronization, dictionary rule spans and per-iterator engine selection are ported and verified; they are not covered by this entry.

Owner decision: 2026-09-29, owner Michael Kinsy approves recording the ICU process-history residual as a narrowed D27 instead of retiring D27 outright, following the rev-d27 review.

Call-site marker: `internal/wordsegmenter/segments.go`: `dictionaryEngines.engineFor`, where a CJK span start selects `CjkBreakEngine` as if the process cache were warm.

Evidence: `internal/wordsegmenter/testdata/sea-icu78.json` (warm-process Node 26.7.0 / ICU 78.3 corpus, including the `engine-selection` cases), `TestICUSoutheastAsianSegments`, `TestICUSoutheastAsianWordNavigation`, and `tui-components/20-editor-word-and-paste-segments` (byte-exact Editor transitions).

Parity allowance: the differential corpus is generated in a warm process. No paired scenario asserts a fresh-process cold-cache result, because Pi's own answer changes with process history.

Remove when: upstream ICU makes engine selection independent of process history, or PiG adopts an owned model of Pi's process-wide engine cache.

## D30 Extension runner is host-scoped, not invalidated on in-process session switch

What: upstream's `AgentSession.dispose()` (agent-session.ts:717) calls
`_extensionRunner.invalidate(staleMessage)` so that a `pi`/command `ctx`
captured before a session replacement (`ctx.newSession()`, `ctx.fork()`,
`ctx.switchSession()`, and the `/new`, `/fork`, `/resume` UI flows that drive
them) throws `ErrStaleContext` on reuse. Upstream owns one `_extensionRunner`
per `AgentSession`, so disposing the outgoing session invalidates exactly that
runner and the incoming session gets a fresh one.

pig uses a single host-scoped extension runner
(`coding/extension/host/inproc/runner.go`) shared across in-process session
switches: `Session.ReplaceInner` (the `/resume` chokepoint) swaps only the
inner session and keeps the same runner, and the `/new` and `/fork` handlers
reuse `m.newRunner`. The invalidation mechanism is fully ported: `Invalidate`,
the byte-identical stale message, and the `ErrStaleContext` sentinel: and it
fires on the two points where pig genuinely builds a new runner:
`ctx.reload()` (`internal/codingagent/reload_resources.go` invalidates the old
runner, then constructs a new one) and runtime close (`coding/runtime.go`).
pig does not invalidate on `/new`, `/fork`, or `/resume` because the same
runner serves the incoming session; calling `Invalidate` there would wedge the
runner for the new session.

Observable effect: an extension that captures a `ctx` and reuses it after an
in-process `/new`, `/fork`, or `/resume` operates against the current session
instead of throwing `ErrStaleContext`. The rest of `dispose()` is covered:
`cleanupSessionResources` runs in `Session.Close()`, the `session_shutdown`
event is emitted on quit/switch, and in-flight compaction/branch-summary are
aborted on `/resume` with agent/bash/compaction teardown on signal/quit
via `context.Context` propagation.

Evidence: the wire audit's module-scope saved-context probe drives this through RPC session replacement on Pi 0.87.1. A factory-local saved variable is insufficient because Pi re-enters the factory. The stale-context behavior is reachable and observable; this record grants no synchronization or comparator exception. Pi's invalidation and access guards are `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/runner.ts:679-690,809-888`; replacement is `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-runtime.ts:167-177`. Retain this implementation gap until per-session invalidation is implemented.

Why deferred, not ported: a faithful fix requires per-session extension
runners (each `/new`/`/fork`/`/resume` builds a fresh runner and re-registers
every extension), a structural change to pig's subprocess host model with
real restart/re-register cost and broad blast radius, for a behavior the
upstream stale-ctx message explicitly warns authors not to rely on. The
capture-and-reuse-across-switch pattern it guards against is misuse; pig's
ctx is request-scoped in normal use.

Call sites:
- `internal/codingagent/interactive.go`: `NewSession` (`/new`),
  `ForkToNewSession` (`/fork`), `LoadSessionPath` (`/resume`).
- Contrast (runner genuinely replaced, so invalidation fires):
  `internal/codingagent/reload_resources.go` (reload),
  `coding/runtime.go` (runtime close).

Remove when: pig adopts a per-session extension runner and invalidates the
outgoing runner on `/new`, `/fork`, and `/resume`.

## D37 Recover from stale thinking-block signatures (retry with signatures stripped)

What: when the Anthropic Messages endpoint (including the github-copilot
Claude proxy) rejects a request with a thinking-block signature error
(`invalid_request_error` whose message contains both `signature` and
`thinking`, e.g. "Invalid `signature` in `thinking` block"), pig retries the
same request once with thinking signatures stripped: every assistant thinking
block is downgraded to a plain text block (reasoning text preserved as
context) and redacted thinking is dropped. If the retry also fails, the second
error is surfaced.

Why: upstream replays every same-model signed thinking block verbatim
(`transform-messages.ts` keeps `isSameModel && block.thinkingSignature`, and
`anthropic-messages.ts convertMessages` sends `signature: thinkingSignature`)
and has no recovery. Thinking signatures generated earlier by the provider
backend can become unreplayable: observed live on `github-copilot`
`claude-opus-4.8` after a long, repeatedly-rewound, model-switched session:
one early same-model thinking block (valid when generated) is rejected as
"Invalid `signature` in `thinking` block" while later ones still validate,
which permanently wedges the session on every resume. This is a provider-side
staleness that upstream shares; pig recovers instead of hard-failing, trading
the (already-broken) reasoning-continuity signature for a working turn. The
reasoning text still reaches the model as text, so context is preserved.

Bug exists in upstream too: this is a fix-in-downstream-with-divergence per
the maintainer directive; remove when upstream gains equivalent recovery or an
upstream issue resolves the provider signature staleness.

Call-site markers:
- `ai/anthropic.go`: `anthropicProvider.Stream` (`// pig divergence (D37)`),

Locked by: `ai/anthropic_test.go` -
`TestAnthropicStream_D37_RetriesOnStaleThinkingSignature` (fail-then-retry,
asserts the retry drops the signature and preserves reasoning text) and
`TestIsThinkingSignatureError` (classifier scope).
Remove when: upstream pi gains equivalent stale-thinking-signature recovery, or
removes thinking-block signatures from the provider contract.
PORT_MAP path: `ai/anthropic.go` (downstream provider resilience; no upstream
equivalent).

## D39 Standalone-binary self-update

What: pig replaces upstream pi's package-manager self-update with a
standalone-binary update path. Upstream detects the install method
(npm/pnpm/yarn/bun) and emits the matching `install -g` command, with the npm
registry as both the version-of-truth and the transport. pig is a single Go
binary (and, in production, a binary baked into a container image), so that
model does not apply: `pig update` (bare): matching upstream's documented
`pi update` "Update pi only": fetches a JSON update manifest from a configured
source, compares the running version to the manifest version, and, when newer,
downloads the platform binary, requires and verifies its SHA256, rejects declared
or streamed content above the bounded size, and atomically replaces the running
executable and its ownership receipt as one rollback-safe operation.
Missing/malformed/mismatched checksums fail before staging. A standalone replacement holds a per-executable OS lock through download, receipt commit, and rollback. A concurrent update fails before downloading. The `<executable>.update.lock` sidecar remains on disk; the OS releases ownership when the process exits. Do not delete a live lock sidecar.

Explicit version checks use Pi's management HTTP policy: at most two immediate retries for transport failures and HTTP 408, 425, 429, 500, 502, 503, or 504, within one ten-second budget. Caller cancellation ends the check. Signature verification and manifest parsing failures are not retried. Startup checks remain best-effort and do not retry.

The signed current
manifest also carries the exact package identity used by package-manager
installs, including an approved package rename.
`pig update self`/`pig` are explicit self aliases; `pig update --extensions`
refreshes every installed package (not pig), `pig update --all` refreshes
all installed packages and then pig, and `pig update <source>` still updates one
package. `--self`, `--extension`, and `--force` follow the shared Pi routing and
conflict rules. (Pig previously made bare `pig update`
update all packages; this aligns it with upstream where bare update is the
self-update.) A startup banner surfaces an available update with the command that applies it. When no source is configured, the source is unreachable, the
platform is unsupported (a standalone Windows binary, or a read-only/containerized
install), pig prints a next-tier fallback ladder: download a new binary or
pull the container image and re-deploy without repeating `pig update`. Installation ownership is explicit before mutation: `ResolveSelfUpdateTier`
proves exactly one owner: writable standalone, package-manager, immutable
Piglet Binary, OCI/Piglet Image, or
read-only/Windows standalone/unknown: and rejects ambiguous ownership. Once a tier
starts, its failure surfaces from that tier and never falls through to another.
The package-manager tier invokes the proven owner's exact `install -g` command. An unconfigured npm command retains the prefix from its proven `lib/node_modules` root. A logical pnpm launcher supplies ownership evidence only when it resolves to the running native executable. Both the owning package directory and its parent must be writable. `SelfUpdateProvenance.GetSelfUpdateCommand` carries this evidence into the signed-release caller; it does not reclassify ownership after the operation starts. The original16 `config.test.ts` cases are covered by `internal/codingagent/config_upstream_test.go`, with caller evidence in `cmd/pig/self_update_prefix_upstream_test.go` and byte-equal command-plan comparison in `cli-utils/16-native-self-update-command-ownership`.

Immutable-binary and container tiers emit exact pull/rebuild/redeploy
remediation rather than in-place drift; read-only/Windows standalone/unknown
tiers refuse and report the executable path plus concrete remediation.

Windows follows upstream for package-manager installs. An npm or pnpm install
updates through its owner's command. Before an npm update, pig quarantines
the running pig.exe under `node_modules/.pig-native-quarantine` and copies it
back, as upstream `prepareWindowsNpmSelfUpdate` does for the native addons it
loaded, because Windows refuses to delete a running image. Every Windows start
clears that quarantine. A yarn or bun install on Windows is refused with
upstream's message ("pig self-update on Windows is only supported for npm and
pnpm installs."). Only a standalone pig.exe stays in the unsupported tier,
because a running Windows executable is not replaced in place.

The update source resolves as `PIG_UPDATE_URL` env, else a transport-neutral
sidecar at `<config-root>/update-url` (written by an installer that knows its
origin at install time, e.g. the marketplace bootstrap), else an optional
build-time `internal/codingagent.DefaultUpdateURL` set by a product's own
release build. PiG's own release builds set it to the latest release's signed
`update.json`, whose `update.json.sig` sits beside it because GitHub release
assets cannot send the `X-Pig-Release-Signature` header, and `install.sh` writes
the standalone receipt, so a script installation updates in place. A Marketplace installer that used an explicit private CA copies
those CA bytes into owner-only `<config-root>/update-ca.pem`; it never persists
the caller's source path. The standalone receipt binds that file's SHA256 to the
executable, release, and update origin. Update HTTP clients add those certificates
to the host system pool, reject changed/unowned/malformed/world-readable CA
material, and continue to require the separately signed release manifest. A
public-CA reinstall removes a prior transport-CA sidecar transactionally.
A managed container deployment that owns a specific redeploy
operation supplies it verbatim through `PIG_REDEPLOY_INSTRUCTION`; Pig renders
that operation inside its own frame (artifact identity, executable path, and the
guarantee that the running image is never rewritten) instead of asserting a
generic `docker pull`, which is wrong for an orchestrator-managed deployment.
Pig performs no product transport and knows no product topology; without that
metadata it falls back to the generic image pull.
Piglet source/build fields and `pig piglet build` never carry
an update endpoint. A Piglet Binary bakes only `release.version` into
`codingagent.PigletBinaryRelease` (published from `main.PigletBinaryVersion`
at startup); update transport remains explicit product or environment policy.
Stock Pig bakes neither a URL nor a Piglet release version.

Why: PiG previously returned nil for `GetSelfUpdateCommand` and used a stale,
unconfigured fallback URL. That silently diverged from upstream because Pi
self-updates and PiG did not. Upstream *does* check for and notify about a new version
(`checkForNewPiVersion` / `showNewVersionNotification`); pig mirrors that
notification ("Update Available. New version X is available. Run `pig update`"),
laid out identically (Spacer, warning DynamicBorder, bold-warning heading +
muted/accent instruction, an optional muted release-note block between spacers,
closing DynamicBorder). The one omission is upstream's trailing `Changelog:
https://pi.dev/changelog` line: that URL is a hardcoded pi-product page with no
generic pig equivalent, so pig drops it rather than bake a dead or wrong link.
Only the update *mechanism* diverges: upstream updates via the package manager,
pig replaces the standalone binary. The self/package command surface matches upstream (`pi update` = self, `--self`, `--extensions`, `--all`,
`--extension`, `--force`, positional package source, and conflict handling),
with `pig` replacing Pi's product name. Upstream's separate `--models` command uses the shared model runtime and is not part of D39. The remote pi.dev catalog overlay remains unported and visible in PORT_MAP; D39 does not claim that model-catalog surface.

Skip conditions:
- `PIG_OFFLINE`/`PI_OFFLINE` disables the startup update check
- unparseable local versions never trigger an update notification
- no update source configured → no check, actionable fallback on `pig update self`

Remove when: upstream pi ships a standalone-binary self-update pig can mirror.
This closes the mechanism's install-ownership, package-manager, immutable
Binary/Image, OCI, Windows/read-only, and unknown-provenance gaps;
this divergence remains only for the unavoidable native delivery mechanism
(standalone in-place replace and the generic update-source sidecar), since
upstream pi self-updates through the npm registry rather than a binary
manifest.

## D44 Positive image capability for Herdr intermediaries

What: when `HERDR_ENV=1`, Pig ignores inherited outer-terminal image hints unless Herdr explicitly sets `HERDR_KITTY_GRAPHICS=1`. Without that positive signal, image components render their compact textual fallback and reserve no graphics rows. Direct Ghostty/Kitty/WezTerm/iTerm sessions retain upstream capability detection. An intervening tmux or screen session still disables automatic image detection, regardless of Herdr's outer graphics hint. Explicit Pi image-protocol and settings overrides keep their upstream precedence.

Why: upstream and Pig normally infer image support from variables such as
`TERM_PROGRAM=ghostty`. Herdr panes inherit those variables, but Herdr is the
terminal renderer and its experimental Kitty graphics support can be disabled.
Treating an outer-terminal identity as forwarding evidence emits image bytes
and blank reserved rows that no layer owns. Keyboard protocol support is a
separate capability and does not authorize graphics.

Remove when: upstream supports positive nested-terminal graphics capability
signals, or Herdr guarantees Kitty graphics for every pane and no longer needs
an opt-in renderer.

## D48 Orphaned and duplicate tool results are stripped from normalized history

What: `NormalizeMessages` (`agent/transform.go`) runs a second pass that
drops any tool-result whose `ToolCallID` matches no surviving tool_use in the
message list, drops the whole tool-result message when none of its results
survive, and drops a repeated result for a tool_use that already has one. Upstream `transformMessages` (`packages/ai/src/api/transform-messages.ts`)
only synthesizes results for orphaned tool *calls*; it never strips orphaned
tool *results*: it pushes them through to the provider unchanged.

Why: pig and upstream both drop errored/aborted assistant turns before provider
conversion (transform-messages.ts:153-159; `transform.go` StopReason check). When
a dropped assistant held the only tool_use for a tool-result that was already
persisted (an abort race where the tool ran and recorded its result before the
turn was marked aborted, a truncated/hand-built session, or a model switch that
dropped the calling turn), the result is left orphaned. Upstream then sends that
orphaned tool-result to the API, which rejects it (OpenAI "No tool call found for
function call output with call_id ...", Anthropic "tool_use_id not found"),
failing the whole request on poisoned history. pig strips it so the request
still succeeds. Making pig faithful here would reintroduce that upstream API
failure on exactly the poisoned-history sessions this risk-core surface must
survive. The strip is inert on clean sessions: every tool-result on a
well-formed session has a matching, surviving tool_use, so nothing is removed.

The same pass enforces one result per tool_use. Providers require exactly one
("each tool_use must have a single result. Found multiple `tool_result` blocks
with id: ..."), and because the rejection happens on every later turn, a single
duplicate makes the session unusable rather than degrading it. Duplicates arise
from a replayed or hand-edited session and from the synthetic placeholder for an
orphaned tool call meeting a real result that arrives out of order. The first
occurrence wins, because a tool_result must directly follow its tool_use and the
first already holds that slot.

Results are matched in order against open calls, not against the set of ids in
the conversation. A call id is not unique across a conversation: a provider that
numbers its calls per response reuses the same id every turn, so the id opens a
new call each time and a result closes whichever call is open when it arrives.
Deduplicating by id alone drops every turn after the first, which stalls the
conversation, and counting occurrences alone lets a duplicate of an early call
consume the allowance belonging to a later one.

A result arriving after the next assistant turn is out of order rather than
missing, so the placeholder slot carries that real result instead of upstream's
`"No result provided"`, and the out-of-position copy is the one dropped. Upstream
emits the placeholder and still sends the late copy, which the provider rejects;
of the two halves of that, telling the model a tool failed when it succeeded is
the more damaging, since the model may retry an operation that already ran. A
tool_use with no result anywhere still receives upstream's placeholder text and
`isError` exactly. Like the orphan strip, all of this is inert on clean sessions,
where every tool_use has exactly one result in position.

Remove when: upstream `transformMessages` strips orphaned tool-results and
enforces one result per tool_use (or otherwise guarantees the provider never
receives a violation), at which point pig's second pass matches upstream and
this divergence is retired.

the production `convertToLLM`→`Stream` path and asserts the orphaned id never
reaches the OpenAI-completions, OpenAI-responses, or Anthropic request body;

three wire formats, over-stripping drops the clean result side.

## D51 Interactive SIGINT restores the terminal before numeric exit 130

What: when SIGINT terminates interactive mode, pig pops its extended-key protocols, restores the cooked state captured at startup, and exits with numeric status 130. Pi 0.87.1 leaves SIGINT to Node's default signal action, so process APIs report signal termination and the terminal stays raw. This exception does not cover print/JSON SIGINT, which must terminate by signal, or a dead terminal, which must exit 129. Both products restore a live terminal and exit 0 on SIGTERM or SIGHUP (`packages/coding-agent/src/modes/interactive/interactive-mode.ts:4145-4157,4231-4249`).

Both halves matter. Without the tcsetattr the terminal stays raw, so the
shell has no working Ctrl+C until `reset`. Without the protocol pop the Kitty
flags pig pushed stay on the terminal's stack, so the shell inheriting the
terminal receives CSI-u encoded keys it does not understand. The teardown goes
out as a single write, which is what makes it safe to run from the signal
goroutine alongside the render loop.
`registerSignalHandlers`
(`packages/coding-agent/src/modes/interactive/interactive-mode.ts`) never
registers a general SIGINT handler, taking SIGINT only to ignore it while
suspended, so the signal falls through to Node's default handler, which exits
without unwinding pi's terminal restore.

pig matches upstream on the part that matters most: SIGINT terminates the
session. It is not treated as an interrupt. Ctrl+C never reaches this path
anyway, because pig holds the terminal in raw mode for the whole session, so
`\x03` is consumed by the keymap. Measured on a live pty: `-isig` while idle
and `-isig` while a bash tool runs. SIGINT is ignored while the temporary suspend listener is installed. If SIGINT and SIGCONT are pending together, a SIGINT dispatched after SIGCONT removes the listener can terminate the resumed process, matching upstream's dispatch-time listener semantics.

Why: Pi 0.87.1 leaves the terminal raw after an external SIGINT. The wire audit re-probed this after a positional extension command completed, rather than at the first painted footer. The shell then has no working Ctrl+C until `reset`. The existing live-PTY regression checks PiG's restoration independently of tmux key encoding.

The signal handler uses only the signal-safe keyboard-protocol disable and termios restoration. Normal teardown also drains stdin for up to a second, which would race the input reader and the render loop. The single-main-loop ownership invariant is enforced by `make test-race`.

Call sites: `internal/codingagent/interactive_tui.go`: `handleInterruptSignal`;
`tui/signal_restore.go`: `RestoreTerminalFromSignal`.

Locked by: `test/integration/signal_shutdown_test.go`
(`TestInteractiveSigintTerminatesAndRestoresTerminal`): asserts the terminal is
sane before launch, raw while pig runs, that pig exits on SIGINT, and that ISIG
is back afterwards. Mutation-proven twice: dropping the restore reddens it with
"without restoring the terminal", and surviving the signal reddens it with
"pig survived SIGINT".

Known gap: the captured state is taken at the first raw-mode entry, and pig
disables SUSP before that, so a restored terminal reports `susp = <undef>`
where a pristine one reports `^Z`. ISIG and INTR are restored correctly.

Remove when: upstream restores the terminal before exiting on SIGINT.

Ratification: user-ratified. Verified by hand in a real terminal (Ghostty):
kill -INT exits pig and leaves the shell with a working Ctrl+C, suspend and
resume are clean, and the cost of matching upstream was accepted after
exercising it directly, namely that Ctrl+C while $EDITOR is open now terminates
pig as it does upstream.

## D53 Full-clear when a differential rewrite would under-clear wrapped rows

What: the differential renderer clears rows with one `\x1b[2K` per logical
buffer row, which assumes each buffer row maps to exactly one physical screen
row. When the terminal narrows and an extension widget re-pushes a frame in a
follow-up render at the now-fixed width, a previous frame's row can be wider
than the new terminal width, so the terminal wrapped it across several
physical screen rows during the intervening render. Rewriting in place then
clears only the first physical row of each logical row, leaving the wrapped
remnants of the previous frame visible above the new frame until a second
resize happens to force a full clear.

Upstream (`packages/tui/src/tui.ts`) uses the same logical-row model and can
leave the same residue. PiG instead clears the full frame. The extra clear is
observable and prevents stale terminal content.

Why: pi-chain (a Node extension) renders a width-sensitive card pipeline.
On a tmux `Ctrl+Z` zoom toggle the pane narrows; the widget's wide frame was
painted before the `width_change` re-push landed, and the follow-up narrow
frame left the wrapped wide rows above it. The renderer change is the minimal
correction at the layer that owns the screen.

Skip conditions:
- if no previous frame row ever exceeds the terminal width, the check never
  fires and behavior is byte-identical to a differential rewrite
- image lines are exempt: `fullRender` and the differential path already
  reserve rows for them, and this check runs only over non-image rows
- the full clear never replaces a differential write that upstream ends with an overflow: when upstream's loop over the changed rows would reach an over-wide row (before any Kitty-image fallback), the differential path runs and terminates as Pi does (`TestOverflowD53DoesNotMaskDifferentialOverflow`)
- the replacement row must also fit: a row over-wide in both frames re-wraps to the same height, so rewriting it in place is correct. Testing only the previous row makes every render that touches a chronically over-wide line a full repaint; the narrower condition fires only when the wrap goes away and would otherwise leave residue.

Call sites: `tui/tui.go`: `doRender`, the wrapped-row guard before
the differential rewrite. Regression: `tui/render_wrap_clear_test.go`
(`TestWideFrameRepushAtNarrowerWidthFallsBackToFullRender`), which fails with
the guard removed (mutation-verified).

Upstream state: upstream pi 0.84.0 stores logical rows and rewrites per row,
so it would show the same artifact; upstream-first says record this rather
than claim parity, and the fallback is observationally identical except the
residue is cleared.
SCRUTINIZED:approved

Remove when: upstream changes the per-row clear semantics so a differential
rewrite is byte-safe under width changes, or the terminal pipeline otherwise

## D55 The global debug hotkey fires once per press

What: pig drops Kitty key releases before matching the `ctrl+shift+d` debug
hotkey, so one press runs the debug handler once. Registered through
`addKeyPressListener`, which filters before any in-tree terminal-input listener
sees the chunk.

Upstream state: `packages/tui/src/tui.ts:850` tests
`matchesKey(data, "shift+ctrl+d")` and calls `onDebug()` at the top of
`handleInput`, 37 lines before its only release filter at :887, which sits
inside the focused-component branch and never runs for this path. `matchesKey`
resolves through `matchesKittySequence` (`keys.ts:653`), which compares the
codepoint and the modifier and ignores the Kitty event type, so it answers true
for the release of the chord as readily as the press. Upstream therefore runs
`onDebug` twice for one keypress whenever the Kitty protocol is active, which is
pig's default because extendedKeyInit pushes flag 2.

Why: the handler writes a debug log and appends a confirmation to the chat, so
upstream's behaviour duplicates both on every use. The affordance exists to make
a bad session legible, and a debug surface that reports each event twice
undermines the one job it has: a reader cannot tell a genuine repeat from the
hotkey's own echo.

Scope is deliberately narrow. It covers this one hotkey, not raw input delivery
in general: extension terminal-input listeners keep seeing unfiltered input
through `addTerminalInputListener`, matching upstream's `addInputListener` and
the `wantsKeyRelease` opt-in its own space-invaders and doom examples rely on.

Call sites: `internal/codingagent/interactive.go`: the debug hotkey
registration, and `addKeyPressListener` which applies the filter.
Regression: `internal/codingagent/debug_hotkey_release_test.go`
(`TestDebugHotkeyFiresOncePerPress`), which fails when the registration is moved
back to `addTerminalInputListener`.
SCRUTINIZED:approved

Remove when: upstream tests the debug hotkey after its key-release filter, or

becomes correct on its own.

## D56 Subprocess liveness and renderer isolation

What: Pig heartbeats a subprocess only while it owns outstanding work or live
provider state. Tools, commands, events, and shortcuts have no host completion
or inactivity timeout. Their caller-owned context remains authoritative, and a
healthy dispatcher keeps the connection alive while awaited work continues.
Renderer work has a five-second inactivity boundary off the TUI loop, retains
the last completed frame, and disables only the stalled generation. A missed
heartbeat closes the logical connection and fails pending work with a typed
`extension_unresponsive` error.

Upstream state: Pi runs extensions in-process and directly awaits callbacks. It
has no subprocess heartbeat, transport failure, packed-cell isolation, or
request-inactivity state machine. Its only extension timeout is the opt-in,
per-dialog `ExtensionUIDialogOptions.timeout` with a visible countdown.

Why: wall-clock completion limits reject valid extension work and interactions
that wait for a person or an external system. Heartbeat verifies that the SDK
dispatcher and transport are responsive without imposing a duration limit on
the operation. Renderer generations remain bounded because rendering is
latency-sensitive and the host can retain the last completed frame. A logical
packed-member failure never quarantines healthy siblings. Shared process death
remains the packed-cell recovery authority. Node recovery isolates an attributable culprit and restarts healthy members together. Unknown failure gets one whole-group restart, then diagnostic bisection on recurrence; identifying the failing member reunites the healthy group (D20). Neither tools nor callbacks interrupted by process death are replayed. Old-generation callbacks and UI frames retain their dead connection identity; only newly invoked named capabilities may use the recovered process. Recovery ends with the original owner or Host shutdown.

The lifecycle handler owns a failed connection's diagnostic when a crash handler is installed. Commands, shortcuts and events interrupted by that connection still fail, but do not emit duplicate notifications. Without a crash handler, the runner reports the invocation error. Ordinary handler rejections are not transport failures. Packed socket-close and process-exit detectors claim each member under the same registry lock, so a late observation neither reports it twice nor unregisters a replacement. Subprocess stderr logs are removed after teardown unless a load or lifecycle diagnostic names them.

Remove when: Pig no longer hosts extensions across a subprocess boundary, or
upstream provides an equivalent subprocess liveness contract that Pig can port
without this divergence.

- `coding/extension/host/subprocess/conn.go`: heartbeat, request state,

## D57 Installing an extension directory as a package is refused

What: `pig install <dir>` fails when the directory satisfies one complete
conventional factory or standalone extension contract and contributes no
Package resources. The source is not recorded. Upstream records it and reports
success, but Package discovery would load nothing. A directory with only a
language or build marker still installs as an empty Package, matching Pi.

Why: an extension root and a Package root have different ownership. A Package
contributes only exact members under its `extensions` inventory. Promoting an
arbitrary Package root because it contains source would make ordinary npm,
Cargo, Python, or Go packages executable extensions. The refusal names direct
`-e`, the canonical agent extension directory, and Package `extensions/` as the
working choices.

Scope: the source resolver proves Go, Rust, and Python factories or exact standalones. Missing standard factories, ambiguous languages or roots, and incomplete source do not trigger this refusal because they do not prove an extension contract. Node factory resolution selects only an entrypoint and defers export validation to the runtime. It does not prove an extension contract. Node Packages, including ordinary npm libraries with `index.js`, therefore install without importing their code or requiring Pi resources, matching Pi's `package-manager.ts:1005-1031`.

Remove when: upstream reports unloadable extension-root installs itself, or
Package discovery gains an equivalent explicit distinction.

## D59 Generic extension tool cards expose complete recoverable details

What: a generic extension tool card retains its complete structured arguments.
Its collapsed header uses the current terminal-cell width for a compact preview
and marks hidden input with `… (ctrl+o to expand)`. The expanded card shows the
complete pretty-printed arguments and complete available result output. A
resize recomputes both the preview budget and expanded wrapping from the
retained value. A generic card is an extension tool that does not override a
built-in tool name and whose definition has no `renderCall`, `renderResult` or
`renderShell` "self". Built-in tools keep their renderers, an override of a
built-in tool draws the built-in renderers it does not define, and an extension
tool with renderers draws them as upstream does.

Upstream state: `ToolExecutionComponent.expanded` starts false and is passed to
custom call/result renderers, but the registered-tool fallback does not consume
it. A registered extension tool counts as having a renderer definition even
when `renderCall` is absent, so `createCallFallback()` shows only the tool name.
Its arguments remain hidden before and after Ctrl+O. `formatToolExecution()`
prints `JSON.stringify(args, null, 2)` only for an unknown tool with no built-in
or extension definition. A custom renderer can define its own collapsed and
expanded output.

Why: Pig's old generic header first truncated every string to 40 characters and
then truncated the combined header to 80 characters. It retained only that
shortened string, so the ellipsis permanently hid the input and Ctrl+O could
never recover it. Fixed character limits also wasted wider terminals. Retaining
the source value makes every display omission explicit and reversible. It also
keeps generic extension cards consistent with Pig's existing recoverable result
preview rather than showing an unbounded argument payload in the transcript by
default.

Tradeoffs:
- The component owns one copy of the argument JSON for its visible lifetime.
  This costs memory proportional to the tool call, but avoids borrowing event
  buffers and is bounded by data already carried in the provider request and
  session record.
- Expanded arguments can add many rows. That cost is explicit and user-driven;
  collapsed cards stay compact.
- Explicit Ctrl+O collapse clears and rebuilds terminal scrollback in collapsed
  form. Native scrollback cannot delete only the expanded rows, so this action
  snaps the reader to the live cursor. Automatic completion follows Pi's
  ordinary main-screen redraw behavior.
- Expanded wrapping preserves every grapheme and space instead of using the
  ordinary word wrapper, which trims whitespace at line breaks. Copying wrapped
  JSON includes display line breaks, but no retained argument character is
  removed.
- The collapsed preview preserves wire key order rather than sorting fields.
  This keeps the displayed value faithful to the call and avoids manufacturing
  a second canonical representation.
- A result that the tool already truncated remains truncated. Pig preserves its
  notice and does not claim Ctrl+O can recover bytes the tool never returned.

Call sites:
- `tui/tool_execution.go`: retained structured arguments, width-aware
  header preview, expanded argument body, and generic final-state policy.
- `internal/codingagent/interactive.go`: generic extension tool detection,

## D61 Session replacement keeps startup-project Services and Resources

What: upstream `AgentSessionRuntime.switchSession()` opens the destination
Session, then calls `createRuntime()` with the destination Session CWD. That
constructs the incoming Session's settings, resource loader, system prompt, and
built-in tools against the destination project. PiG's `coding.Session.ReplaceInner`
swaps the Session history, identity, model, thinking level, and persisted CWD
inside one host-scoped runtime. It does not reconstruct `coding.Services`, the
resolved Resource set, or built-in tool instances.

Observable effect: after an in-process switch to a Session whose recorded CWD is
a different project, direct RPC Bash runs in the destination CWD because it reads
the active inner Session. Built-in tools, project settings, context files,
prompts, skills, themes, and the system prompt still use the project selected at
process startup. Same-project new, fork, clone, resume, and switch operations are
unaffected.

Why deferred: a faithful fix is the same per-Session runtime reconstruction
required to retire D30. Updating only tool CWD would leave settings, resources,
and the system prompt stale while making the partial switch appear complete.
PiG must replace these as one owned runtime transition, rebind event forwarding,
and preserve cancellation and extension lifecycle order.

Call site:
- `coding/session.go`: `Session.ReplaceInner`, the shared replacement
  chokepoint used by RPC and interactive new/resume/fork/clone flows.

Parity allowance: current replacement scenarios deliberately use Session
fixtures whose CWD is rewritten to each binary's isolated working-directory
snapshot. A cross-project scenario would only restate this approved gap until
the runtime can rebuild the complete destination Resource closure.

Remove when: every Session replacement constructs and atomically installs
Services, settings, resources, system prompt, tools, event forwarding, and an
extension runner for the destination CWD; then add a cross-project switch
scenario that proves destination context and tool resolution.

## D62 /bug exports locally and links to a PiG issue

What: Pi's `/bug` asks for consent, then either uploads the report to Earendil's report gateway or exports a zip archive. PiG runs the same consent flow (description, transcript consent, optional model-written summary) but offers only the export. It writes `pig-bug-report-<id>.zip` to the current directory, records the same `pi.bug-report` session entry with `delivery: "zip"`, and prints a prefilled link to the PiG bug issue form. The link carries only the form fields `title` (the first line of the description, at most 72 characters), `version`, `platform`, and `actual` (the report ID and archive name). It never carries session content. The user attaches the archive. The command description is "Export a bug report to attach to a PiG issue" instead of "Report a bug to the Pi developers".

Why: PiG is not an Earendil product. Sending PiG reports to Pi's gateway would misdirect them and share user data with a party the user did not choose. The owner ratified export-only plus a PiG issue link on 2026-09-23 (delivery/WORKSTREAMS.md 16).

Observable effect: the delivery selector lists "Export as Zip" and "Cancel" with no "Upload Report". PiG makes no network request for a report; only the optional summary calls the session's own provider, after the same consent prompt as Pi. `diagnostics.json` carries the crash log (`<agentDir>/crashes.json`) as Pi's does, and a written report clears it.

## D63 `--version` prints PiG's composite version

What: `pi --version` prints Pi's bare version (for example `0.87.1`). `pig --version` prints one composite version: PiG's release with the Pi release PiG ports as semver build metadata (for example `0.2.0+0.87.1`, `coding.Version`). The help and diagnostics banner, the interactive startup line, `pig build`'s installed line, and `pig verify` show the same composite. `pig version` keeps its separate `pig:` and `upstream pi:` fields, which the Piglet image check and `pig build` read.

Why: one string tells a user both which PiG they run and which Pi it ports. The owner chose this on 2026-09-23.

Observable effect: a script that runs `pig --version` and expects Pi's bare version sees `0.2.0+0.87.1`. Semver precedence ignores build metadata, so the composite sorts as `0.2.0`; self-update comparisons, release tags, and the Piglet compatibility check still use `coding.PigVersion` itself.

- `cmd/pig/main.go`: `cliVersionString`.

Locked by: `cmd/pig/main_test.go` `TestCLIVersionStringIsCompositeVersion`; the parity scenario `test/parity/scenarios/startup/01-version-flag.toml` asserts both outputs in its `[diverge]` block.

## D64 PiG's hosted endpoints live on pi-in-go.dev

What: Pi 0.87.1 points its hosted endpoints at pi.dev and uploads shared-session artifacts to Earendil's Radius gateway at `radius.pi.dev`. PiG serves its hosted paths from `https://pi-in-go.dev` through the private PiG platform repository. The version check, install report, and managed installer API keep Pi's response shapes at the PiG host; the installer API serves PiG GitHub Release archives and returns 404 for npm-only `package.json` and `package-lock.json` paths because PiG has no npm package.

Pi's `/share` uploads an organization-visible JSONL artifact to Radius only when Radius auth is available, then otherwise falls back to a private GitHub gist. PiG always requires the explicit `/share` command, displays a persistent privacy notice before the request, and uploads the same `exportSessionForShare` JSONL shape to `https://pi-in-go.dev/v1/artifacts?visibility=unlisted&title=PiG+session`. PiG needs neither Radius nor `gh` login for this path. The PiG platform stores at most 8 MiB per artifact, gives it an unlisted `https://pi-in-go.dev/session/p_<id>` URL, and expires it after 30 days. `PI_SHARE_GATEWAY_URL` explicitly replaces the complete upload URL; `PI_INSTALLER_API_BASE` keeps its upstream meaning for the installer.

Pi's `reportInstallTelemetry` (interactive-mode.ts:1292-1307) sends its anonymous install/update ping to `https://pi.dev/api/report-install?version=<version>`. PiG sends the identical ping — only the `version` query parameter, plus PiG's own `User-Agent` — to `https://pi-in-go.dev/api/report-install?version=<version>` instead, fired at the same two occasions Pi fires it (a fresh install, and an update whose changelog has new entries), gated by the same `enableInstallTelemetry` setting and `PI_TELEMETRY`/`PI_OFFLINE` env overrides, with the same 5s timeout and fire-and-forget error handling. `PIG_INSTALL_TELEMETRY_URL` explicitly replaces the endpoint (tests use it to point at a local server; there is no upstream equivalent).

Why: PiG is not an Earendil product. Sending PiG users or Session data to pi.dev, radius.pi.dev, or an implicit third-party gist would misattribute PiG traffic and depend on a service PiG does not operate. The owner chose `pi-in-go.dev` on 2026-09-23 and approved the explicit, privacy-noted PiG share gateway on 2026-09-24 (delivery/OWNER-DECISIONS.md).

Observable effect: `/share` shows what Session data will be uploaded, runs the request behind an Escape-cancellable loader, and prints a 30-day unlisted PiG URL instead of a Radius or GitHub-gist URL. Anyone with that URL can read the artifact. The install/update ping goes to `pi-in-go.dev` instead of `pi.dev`; the PiG-hosted endpoint stores one Analytics Engine data point per call (the version and arrival time only) and rate-limits at 10 calls/minute per client. PiG does not read Pi's `PI_SHARE_VIEWER_URL`, so `--help` does not list it or its pi.dev default. Other hosted endpoint clients use `pi-in-go.dev` instead of `pi.dev` as they land.

## D65 PiG identifies itself as `pig/<coding.Version>`

What: upstream `getPiUserAgent()` has two package-local forms. The AI helper (`packages/ai/src/utils/pi-user-agent.ts`) sends every HTTP provider request's default `User-Agent` as `pi (<platform> <release>; <arch>)` (or `pi (browser)` with no Node/Bun runtime). The coding-agent helper (`packages/coding-agent/src/utils/pi-user-agent.ts`) reports `pi/<version> (<platform>; <runtime>; <arch>)` for management requests and bug-report metadata. PiG has no browser build and always runs as a native process, so both PiG surfaces use the one owner-approved product identity: `pig/<coding.Version> (<platform> <release>; <arch>)`, for example `pig/0.2.0+0.87.1 (darwin 25.6.0; arm64)`. The release comes from `uname` on unix (`ai/user_agent_unix.go`, `internal/codingagent/bug_report_unix.go`) and from `RtlGetVersion` on Windows (`ai/user_agent_windows.go`, `internal/codingagent/bug_report_windows.go`), matching Node's `os.release()` on each platform.

Why: PiG is not Pi; providers, diagnostics, and their logs should distinguish PiG traffic and artifacts from Pi's, and identify both the PiG release and the Pi release it ports. The owner chose this shape on 2026-09-23 (delivery/OWNER-DECISIONS.md Q4).

Observable effect: every default provider `User-Agent` (Anthropic Messages, OpenAI Completions, OpenAI/Azure/Codex Responses, Google Generative AI/Vertex, Mistral Conversations) and the `report.json` environment identity in an exported bug report read `pig/...` instead of one of Pi's `pi...` forms. A user-configured provider `User-Agent` header overrides the default except for OpenAI Codex Responses, whose upstream `buildBaseCodexHeaders` deliberately reapplies the product identity after model/request headers. An Anthropic OAuth (subscription-token) request keeps sending `claude-cli/2.1.280` regardless (D63's sibling decision, Q3): that identity is not `getPiUserAgent()`'s output and is untouched by this divergence.

Call sites:
- `ai/anthropic_client.go`: `mergeAnthropicClientHeaders` (seeds the `User-Agent` key; the Claude Code OAuth identity still wins on the wire).
- `ai/openai.go`, `ai/openai_responses.go` (also reached by `ai/azure_openai_responses.go` and `ai/openai_codex_responses.go`, which delegate to the same request builder), `ai/google.go` (also reached by `ai/google_vertex.go`), `ai/mistral.go`: the `User-Agent` header construction. Ordinary model/request headers retain upstream override precedence; Codex uses `forceUserAgent` to mirror its trailing `headers.set("User-Agent", getPiUserAgent())`.
- `internal/codingagent/bug_report.go`: `codingAgentUserAgent`, used for the local bug-report metadata field retained by D62.

## D66 Narrow TUI rows stay within the requested width

What: PiG keeps two narrow-width component paths within their requested terminal-cell width. `TruncatedText.Render` reduces horizontal padding when the full padding plus one content cell would exceed the width. At width 1 with one column of horizontal padding, PiG renders `"A"`; upstream renders `" A "`, which is three cells wide. `UserMessageSelector.Render` also clips each list, metadata, empty-state, and scroll-indicator row after adding the cursor or indentation. Upstream's `UserMessageList` truncates only the message body and then adds its two-cell cursor, while metadata and other rows are unbounded. `Editor.Render` at width 1 without padding highlights the final grapheme of a line when the cursor is at its end, rendering `"g"` as one inverse `g`; upstream appends a highlighted space, two cells wide. At every wider width, and with padding, PiG appends the space as upstream does.

Why: both upstream paths can emit a row wider than the terminal. Upstream's main screen treats that as fatal only in its differential-render loop and stops with `Rendered line exceeds terminal width`; initial, full, and resize renders emit the over-wide row unchanged. PiG preserves the complete padding and rows at ordinary widths, but prioritizes keeping an unusually narrow pane usable instead of emitting an over-wide row.

Observable effect: at widths where fixed padding, cursor text, or metadata cannot fit, PiG removes padding or clips the row while Pi emits an over-wide row and terminates if that row reaches the main screen's differential-render overflow check.

Call-site markers:
- `tui/truncated_text.go`: the horizontal-padding clamp in `TruncatedText.Render`.
- `tui/user_message_selector.go`: the final row-width bound in `UserMessageSelector.Render`.
- `tui/editor.go`: the final-grapheme cursor in `Editor.buildVisualLines`.

Locked by: `tui/component_width_table_test.go` `TestSelectorDialogListComponentsNeverExceedRenderWidth`, whose `TruncatedText`, `UserMessageSelector`, `UserMessageSelectorScrolled`, `UserMessageSelectorEmpty`, and `EditorSlashAutocomplete` cases render every width from 1 through 120 and reject any over-wide row, and `tui/editor_overlay_cursor_test.go` `TestEditorCursorAtWidthOneStaysInBounds` pins the editor's width-1 row. Restoring upstream's full padding or removing the selector's final clip fails the matching width-1 case.

Parity allowance: paired interactive scenarios use a viable terminal width. The intentional difference exists only when these rows cannot fit; the width matrix directly locks the allowed behavior and its boundary.

PORT_MAP paths: `packages/tui/src/components/truncated-text.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/interactive/components/user-message-selector.ts`, and `packages/tui/src/components/editor.ts`.

Remove when: upstream clamps `TruncatedText` padding, bounds every user-message selector row, and fits the editor's end-of-line cursor at width 1, or its main screen safely handles over-wide rows without terminating.

## D68 Windows owner-only files are enforced by DACL

What: PiG requires some files to be readable by their owner only and writes some that way: Piglet `secrets` read `from: {file: ...}`, the secret environment file staged for the agent container, a Piglet signing private key, the self-update transport CA sidecar, and the standalone self-update receipt. On Linux and macOS that is mode `0600` (no group or other permission bits). Windows has no POSIX mode bits, so there `internal/ownerfile` creates the file with a protected DACL (no inherited entries) whose only entry grants the current user full access, as part of the creation itself, and accepts a file only when its DACL allows no one but the file's owner, SYSTEM, and Administrators. A NULL DACL, an allow entry for any other principal, and object or callback allow entries are refused.

Why: mode bits do not exist on Windows (Go reports 0666 for every writable file), so the POSIX check refused every such file there and a written file got no protection. The DACL form gives the same guarantee, access by the owner only, while still allowing SYSTEM and Administrators, which Windows grants on user profile files by default. The lead chose this contract for Piglet secret files on 2026-09-25 (team/lead/inbox WIN-NOTES.md, Q4). Q4 does not establish approval for signing private keys, the update transport CA sidecar, or standalone update receipts. Their existing use of this policy remains pending the explicit Q15 scope decision; the approval marker below applies to the Piglet secret-file contract only.

Observable effect: on Windows a file that inherits the default ACL of a user profile directory is accepted, a file with an Everyone, Users, or other-user allow entry is refused with the same "owner-only" error as on POSIX, and the files PiG writes carry a protected current-user-only DACL from the moment they exist, so no other principal can open them before they hold a secret. Upstream Pi has no Piglet secrets, signing keys, or standalone update receipts, so no Pi behavior changes.

Call-site markers:
- `internal/ownerfile/ownerfile_windows.go`: `CreateNew` (and `CreateTemp` through it) and `OwnerOnly`, used by `coding/piglet` (secrets and the staged secret environment), `coding/piglet/signature` (private keys), and `internal/codingagent` (update transport CA and standalone receipt).

Locked by: `internal/ownerfile` `TestCreateNewIsOwnerOnlyBeforeItsFirstWrite` and `TestCreateTempIsOwnerOnlyBeforeItsFirstWrite` (in a directory whose new files Everyone can read); `coding/piglet/signature` `TestKeygenPrivateKeyIsOwnerOnlyBeforeItsFirstByte`; `coding/piglet` `TestSecretFileMustBeOwnerOnly` and `TestAC7PigletSecretsFailClosedAtResolution/unsafe_file_permissions` (an Everyone read entry on Windows, mode 0644 elsewhere, must be refused), `TestOwnerOnlySecretFileHasAProtectedCurrentUserDACL` (Windows), `TestAC7SecretEnvironmentFileIsProtectedAndValuesStayOffArgv`, and `TestAC7PigletSecretContract`; `coding/piglet/signature` `TestKeygenAndTrustStore`; `internal/codingagent` `TestUpdateTransportCASidecarRejectsUnsafeMaterial`. Making the Windows check accept every file fails the refusal tests.

Parity allowance: none of these files has an upstream counterpart; the unit tests above lock the contract on each platform.

Remove when: never, unless Windows gains POSIX permission bits or these files stop requiring owner-only access.

## D70 /reload re-evaluates every extension module, not only its factory

What: on `/reload`, Pig replaces every enabled extension with a fresh runtime process, including an extension whose source and cached artifact are unchanged. The new process imports the extension module and calls its factory, so module-level state (top-level `let` bindings, module-scope caches, counters, open handles) starts over after every reload. Factory-scoped state starts over in both Pi and Pig.

Upstream state: Pi 0.87.1's `DefaultResourceLoader.reload` calls `clearExtensionCache()` and invokes every extension factory again inside the same Node process. Whether the module body runs again depends on its loader: jiti (`moduleCache: false`) re-evaluates a `.ts` module, while a `.mjs` module stays in Node's native ESM cache and its module-level state survives the reload. Both behaviors were probed directly on Pi 0.87.1 (module-eval and factory-call logs across two reloads: `.ts` evaluated 2x with 2 factory calls; `.mjs` evaluated 1x with 3 factory calls).

Observable effect: an `.mjs` (or natively imported `.js`) extension that keeps state at module scope sees it reset by Pig's `/reload` and retained by Pi's. Extensions that keep state inside the factory, or `.ts` extensions, behave the same on both.

Why: Pig hosts extensions outside its own process, so an extension instance is a runtime process. Re-invoking a factory inside a retained process would need an in-process re-registration protocol and would keep a process whose registrations are being replaced, which the atomic start-beside/swap/stop-old reload transaction is built to avoid. A fresh process matches the part of the contract that holds for every Pi loader, which is that each factory runs again on reload.

Call-site markers:
- `coding/extension/host/subprocess/reload_cells.go`: `stageIsolated`, where an unchanged extension is started as a fresh process.

Locked by: `coding/extension/host/subprocess/host_test.go` `TestHost_Reload_UnchangedExtensionStartsFreshInstance` (an unchanged extension gets a new process on reload), and parity scenario `test/parity/scenarios/extensions-runtime/15-footer-status-reload-composition.toml`, whose fixture advances a persisted generation in its factory and requires both binaries to reach generation 3 after two reloads.

Parity allowance: no paired scenario asserts module-scope state across `/reload`, because Pi's result depends on the extension's file type and Pig's is the same for all of them. Scenario 15 keeps its state in the factory, the per-reload contract both share.

Remove when: Pig re-invokes TS/JS extension factories inside a retained Node runtime on reload, using Pi's loader semantics (jiti re-evaluation for `.ts`, the native module cache for `.mjs`), or when upstream reload re-evaluates every extension module.

## D73 Live main-process object identity does not cross into Node extensions

What: inside an extension process, `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`, `@earendil-works/pi-tui`, `@earendil-works/pi-ai`, and `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core` export every runtime value their Pi 0.87.1 packages export. Imported objects execute in the extension process, not in the Go host.

Pi's own code, copied verbatim from the pinned release into `shims/pi-dist` with the third-party releases Pi depends on (`yaml`, `marked`, `get-east-asian-width`, `partial-json`, `highlight.js`, `ignore`, `diff`, TypeBox):
- pi-coding-agent: the complete published root module graph, including AgentSession, ModelRuntime, SessionManager, SettingsManager, ResourceLoader, tool factories and renderers, compaction, selectors, theme helpers, and the SDK factories. `createAgentSession` delegates to Pi's implementation and binds independent child cleanup to its extension connection. The main Go Session is not exposed as an imported JavaScript AgentSession.
- pi-agent-core, the whole package (its `Agent`, agent loops, harness, compaction, session storage and tools), with the chord and pi-telemetry modules it imports. As Pi's SDK does, the runtime installs pi-ai's compat `streamSimple` as the default stream function, so an extension's `Agent` streams through PiG's providers (D74).
- pi-tui: every public runtime export, including `ScrollView`, `Image`, image/capability/cell-dimension helpers, `ProcessTerminal`, `TuiMainScreen`, `TuiAltScreen`, and `getNativeClipboard`. The complete JavaScript module tree and Pi's native helper prebuilds are bundled. TypeScript-only types are not fabricated runtime classes. Caller-created screens operate on their supplied Terminal; importing a screen does not replace the host's live Main Screen.
- pi-ai: its compat entry point, which Pi serves for the pi-ai root and `/compat`, and `providers/all`, with only its builtin API implementations running in PiG's host (D74).

The imported pure helpers, tool definitions, components, and themes execute Pi's code. The host publishes its active palette to the extension process's global theme and publishes measured terminal dimensions, including `process.stdout.columns` and `process.stdout.rows`. D74 still governs built-in provider execution. Independent imported objects do not expose the Go Main Screen or let a prototype patch modify a Go component.

Independent file-backed stores use PiG's configuration root by default (D2). `PIG_USE_PI_DIRS=1` selects `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` or `~/.pi/agent` and project `.pi` instead. `SettingsManager` reads the selected project settings unless the caller passes `{ projectTrusted: false }`. Node uses the exact pinned proper-lockfile dependency. Go auth, model, settings and trust stores use the same directory-lock protocol, so a Node child can open those stores without encountering a regular-file sidecar from its host. PiG reclaims an empty regular sidecar from v0.2.0 only after its mtime passes the operation's stale threshold (10 seconds synchronous, 30 seconds asynchronous), taking its old OS lock and rechecking file identity and mtime. Fresh regular sidecars use normal contention retries or caller cancellation. A live older writer keeps its lock; stop that older PiG if acquisition times out. Nonempty files, symlinks and live lock directories are not reclaimed. This recovers PiG-owned upgrade state; it does not change the directory protocol used by Pi and Node children.

`CustomEditor` is Pi's, a subclass of pi-tui's `Editor`, and `ctx.ui.setEditorComponent` installs the factory's editor the way Pi's `setCustomEditorComponent` does. The editor runs in the extension process: the factory receives a TUI (terminal size, `requestRender`, `terminal.write`, `setShowHardwareCursor`/`getShowHardwareCursor`), Pi's editor theme and the keybindings manager below; the host sends it the editor text, padding, autocomplete size and focus Pi copies, every key while it is installed, a left click on its rows in fullscreen mode, and each `setText`, `insertTextAtCursor` and `addToHistory` Pi's host performs on its editor; it shows the rows the editor renders, cursor marker included, and runs the default editor's handlers for its callbacks (`onSubmit`, `onChange`, `onEscape`, `onCtrlD`, `onPasteImage`, `onExtensionShortcut` and the `app.*` action handlers). Editor-local clear, follow-up clearing and idle bash Escape run synchronously in the component process; their host callbacks do not replay those text mutations. An input-completion notification holds the input pump until the component's callbacks reach the owner loop, without blocking rendering or accumulating later keys. Its border color follows the thinking level and bash mode as Pi's `updateEditorBorderColor` sets it, and its autocomplete provider asks the host, which answers with the suggestions PiG's own editor would show for the same text.

The keybindings manager handed to editor and `ctx.ui.custom` factories, and installed as pi-tui's global keybindings, is Pi's full table: every `tui.*` and `app.*` definition with the user's `keybindings.json` overrides, sent by the host with each state snapshot.

Partial, with the reason:
- The live Main Screen, arbitrary Go component references, and prototype patches to Go-owned UI objects do not cross into Node. Imported UI classes and `Theme` instances are independent objects. `initTheme` changes the extension process's theme; use `ctx.ui.setTheme` to request a host theme change.
- `ui.custom` publishes its mounted overlay handle and supports visibility, focus, bounds and ordinary unfocus controls. An explicit `unfocus({target})` requires a live main-process component reference and remains unavailable.
- An editor component's autocomplete provider carries no `triggerCharacters` from other extensions' provider wrappers; it uses Pi's default trigger characters.
- `CONFIG_DIR_NAME` and `getAgentDir` name PiG's configuration tree (D2).
- `getPackageDir` identifies the shipped private Node SDK and its assets, not the Node interpreter or PiG executable directory. The harness package also exports that SDK for absolute package-root imports.

No manufactured class/function stand-ins remain in the coding-agent or TUI package exports. The export audit is `test/parity/unit-evidence/node-shim-audit.md`; the restored TUI module tests and `test/parity/unit-evidence/fix-node-scrollview.md` qualify the TUI portion. The fabricated pi-ai `registerSessionResourceCleanup` and `cleanupSessionResources` values are removed because neither is a runtime export in Pi 0.87.1. Live main-process identity remains restricted as described above.

Independent construction is implemented by the pinned SDK modules. `extensions-runtime/53-node-independent-session` exercises child-only models, provider hooks, built-in and custom tools, persistence and cancellation without changing the parent. The locked `pi-btw@0.6.1` replay exercises side requests, overlay reuse, cancellation and a subsequent independent main turn. See `test/parity/unit-evidence/fix-node-createagentsession.md`.

Why: extensions execute in a Node process beside the Go host. Independent Pi objects can run there, but the Go Main Screen and its component identities do not become JavaScript objects.

Observable effect: imported independent SDK objects work, while operations requiring live main-process component references fail explicitly. Editor input and frames cross the extension connection, so rendering follows the input round trip rather than an in-process call.

Call-site markers:
- `coding/extension/host/subprocess/runtime-node/overlay-handle.mjs`: explicit main-process focus targets.
- `coding/extension/host/subprocess/runtime-node/runtime.mjs`: the keybindings manager handed to `ctx.ui.custom` and editor factories, and the host capabilities seeded into pi-tui's cache.
- `coding/extension/host/subprocess/runtime-node/editor-component.mjs`: the editor component's wiring to the host.

Locked by: `coding/extension/host/subprocess` `TestNodeRuntimeShimsExportEveryPinnedPiValue`, which collects every runtime export of the upstream module Pi serves for each specifier (pi-coding-agent and pi-tui `src/index.ts`, pi-ai `src/compat.ts` and `src/providers/all.ts`, pi-agent-core `src/index.ts`, following `export *`) and fails if the loader's module lacks any of them; `TestVendoredPiDistMatchesThePinnedPackage` (the copied Pi code and third-party packages equal the pinned release); `TestPiTuiComponentsMatchThePinnedPackage` and `TestPiAiUtilitiesMatchThePinnedPackage` (the runtime's modules render, handle input and compute byte-identically to the pinned packages); `TestNodeCustomFactoryGetsKeybindingsAndFocus`; `TestNodeExtensionSeesPiProcessIdentity` (`getPackageDir`); `TestNodeStateSeedsTerminalCapabilitiesForMarkdown`; `TestPiSettingsManagerMatchesThePinnedPackage`; `TestNodeSettingsManagerSharesPigSettings`; `TestNodeEditorComponentIsPisCustomEditor`; `TestRemoteEditorLocalClearDoesNotReplayOverNextKey`; `TestPiThemeHelpersMatchThePinnedPackage` (the theme helpers against Pi's own theme and keybinding-hints modules for the dark theme); `TestPiToolFactoriesMatchThePinnedPackage` (the tool factories' shape, metadata and results against Pi's); and `TestNodeRuntimeParseFrontmatterMatchesPi`; `TestImportedRegistryAndSessionClassesMatchPi`; `TestNodeComposedProviderAuthMatchesPi`.

Parity allowance: no paired scenario asserts arbitrary live Go component identity from a Node extension. `extensions-runtime/53-node-scrollview-footer` proves real ScrollView rendering and retained state, with unrelated extensions preserving the footer slot. `TestPiTuiPublicExportsAreRealImplementations` and `TestNodeVendoredTuiUpstreamTests` exercise the restored pi-tui exports against pinned Pi. See `test/parity/unit-evidence/fix-node-scrollview.md` for the real gentle-pi package comparison. `extensions-runtime/35-custom-editor-component` compares SettingsManager-backed modal input and rendering; `35b-editor-action-sync` proves the same-turn clear. `extensions-runtime/31-extension-runtime-surface` compares pi-agent-core and the read and write tool definitions against Pi.

Remove when: live main-process object operations preserve Pi's identity and callback behavior across the extension boundary, or upstream removes that object-sharing contract.

## D74 Pi-ai's builtin API implementations run in PiG's host

What: inside an extension process, pi-ai's compat layer, API registry, lazy API wrappers, model catalog and env-key lookup are Pi's own code (D73). The ten builtin API implementations they load (`anthropic-messages`, `openai-completions`, `openai-responses`, `azure-openai-responses`, `openai-codex-responses`, `google-generative-ai`, `google-vertex`, `mistral-conversations`, `bedrock-converse-stream`, `pi-messages`) are replaced by a bridge. For each request the bridge applies that API's upstream credential check (`options.apiKey`, the headers that stand in for one, or ambient credentials for Vertex and Bedrock) and upstream's `Request aborted` for a signal that already fired, then streams the request through PiG's Go port of the same provider: `options.apiKey` owns the request ahead of every configured credential, `options.reasoning` sets the thinking level (a `stream()` call and a `streamSimple()` call without one run without reasoning, not at the session's level), headers and env pass through, and an aborted `options.signal` cancels the host request. `openrouter-images` `generateImages` returns an error result, because PiG has no image-generation provider.

Why: the upstream implementations import the vendor SDKs (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `openai`, `@google/genai`, `@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime`), which PiG does not ship to extensions, and PiG already carries parity-tested Go ports of these providers, which its own agent uses. Running every builtin API through one bridge keeps credential resolution and request behavior uniform. Owner-directed launch P0 fix (Reddit report on 2026-09-26: pi-hermes-memory calls `completeSimple` from `@earendil-works/pi-ai/compat`).

Observable effect: an extension's `stream`/`complete`/`streamSimple`/`completeSimple` sends the same request (credential, model, messages) and receives the same event and result shapes as under Pi, from PiG's provider; a request aborted in flight carries the Go provider's abort message rather than the vendor SDK's. Provider-specific `stream()` options beyond the common ones (for example Anthropic `thinkingEnabled`) are not forwarded, results lack `responseId` and `rawStopReason`, and `generateImages` for OpenRouter returns an error result where Pi generates images.

- `coding/extension/host/subprocess/runtime-node/shims/pi-ai-bridge.mjs`: the bridge the vendored `api/<api>.js` stubs load.

Locked by: `coding/extension/host/subprocess` `TestVendoredPiDistMatchesThePinnedPackage` (every vendored pi-ai file is verbatim except the listed bridge stubs), `TestNodeRuntimeShimsExportEveryPinnedPiValue` (the compat surface), and `TestNodeCompatCompletionAbortCancelsHostRequest` (the extension's `apiKey` reaches the host, no session thinking level is applied, and an aborted signal cancels the host request).

Parity allowance: no paired scenario runs an extension's direct provider call; the Pi-extension end-to-end run compares pi-hermes-memory's consolidation request and result against Pi 0.87.1 over a scripted OpenAI-compatible server.

Remove when: PiG ships the vendor SDKs to extensions and runs upstream's API implementations, or upstream removes the compat entry point's global dispatch.

## D77 Explicit Node isolation prevents sharing pi.events

What: an explicitly isolated Node extension (`isolation: strict`) or an exact standalone runs in a separate process and cannot share `pi.events` with extensions in another process. Ordinary Node factories share Pi's actual event bus, including across an interleaved native factory. Listeners receive the same object, their synchronous bodies run before `emit()` returns, and `on()` returns Pi's unsubscribe function (`core/event-bus.ts:11-31`). Failed factories discard their subscriptions.

Why: a JSON relay cannot preserve arbitrary JavaScript references, synchronous mutations, closures or reentrant callbacks. Automatically colocating an explicitly isolated extension would violate the requested process boundary. Interleaved loading no longer requires separate Node cells. Crash containment is governed by D20/D56: healthy members restart together; temporary bisection diagnoses repeated unknown failures rather than permanently isolating every member.

Observable effect: cooperating ordinary Node factories share events as in Pi. An author who explicitly selects isolation, or supplies an exact standalone, gives up cross-process bus sharing. Native SDKs do not expose this JavaScript-local object bus; this record does not claim a cross-language bus API.

Call-site markers:
- `coding/extension/host/subprocess/runtime-node/runtime.mjs`: the process's event bus.

Locked by: `TestNodeRuntimeEventBusMatchesPi`, `TestNodeCellInterleavedGoFactoryKeepsOrderAndBus`, `TestNodeCrashQuarantinesOnlyCulpritAndDoesNotReplay`, `TestNodeUnattributableCrashRestartsWholeGroup`, `TestNodeRepeatedUnknownCrashBisectsAndRejoinsHealthyMembers`, and scenarios `extensions-runtime/31-extension-runtime-surface` and `52-interleaved-node-admission`.

Parity allowance: the paired scenarios exercise ordinary shared factories. Strict isolation and exact standalones have no Pi process-boundary equivalent; `TestPlanCellsDoesNotPackNonFactoryOrStrictIsolation` and `TestNodeCellIsolatedEscapeHatchGetsOwnProcess` preserve the explicit isolation decision.

Remove when: the host preserves synchronous delivery, reference identity and callback behavior across process boundaries without weakening requested isolation, or upstream restricts its event bus to a process-local contract.

Ratification: explicitly approved by owner Michael Kinsy on 2026-09-27 for the narrowed scope above: explicitly isolated extensions (`isolation: strict`) and exact standalones have their own bus; ordinary Node factories share Pi's bus. Crash recovery remains governed by D20/D56. This approval adds no runtime warning.

## D78 SDK Provider object carriers

What: the remaining SDK Provider object surface is a documented known gap for 0.3.x. Registered native Providers have callable cross-process handles, but Go, Rust and Python `getProvider` cannot retrieve every builtin/composed raw Provider and report the unavailable carrier explicitly. Registered configuration data crossing a process boundary is a snapshot, not a transparent live alias of the author's object. Callable capabilities do not imply shared container identity.

Why: Pi retains actual Provider/configuration objects in one JavaScript heap. JSON cannot preserve arbitrary author-held aliases, getters/setters, method receivers or subsequent unproxied writes across address spaces. A safe shared-reference design also needs source ownership, captured child/function identity, descriptor semantics, validation of unused cyclic metadata, and distributed lifetime/cycle handling. A reader facade alone does not implement that contract. The builtin/composed native SDK representation also lacks parts of Pi's raw Provider surface.

Observable effect: a foreign configuration reader cannot use reference equality or a local property mutation to observe or update the author's object. Captured children and functions must not be described as live remote aliases merely because a method can be invoked. Native SDK callers can encounter the explicit builtin/composed carrier error. Node's independent builtin/composed objects still use Pi's factories. Implemented stream/auth/callback methods keep their existing contract.

Scope: only the named SDK surface and cross-process configuration identity gaps. When caller and referents share a Node process, the accepted configuration root, shallow root replacement, original children/functions, descriptors and receivers must remain Pi-exact. A same-process copy, stale registration lookup or incorrect rollback is not authorized by the foreign-data boundary. The current integration does not yet contain the later configuration-carrier and same-process-root work; approval is not a claim that those checkpoints are integrated or qualified. Numeric credential presence/precision, implicit refresh, post-callback signal lifetime, mixed-owner replacement/rollback and resource qualification remain explicitly incomplete in the Provider work, not silently certified by this entry.

Owner decision: 2026-09-28, owner Michael Kinsy approves recording the remaining Provider surface and the foreign registered-config identity proposal as visible known gaps for 0.3.x. This supersedes D78's pending scrutiny, not its implementation obligations. It grants no comparator relaxation, fabricated callback result, compatibility reader or general lifecycle waiver.

Call-site markers:
- `extensions/sdk/provider_proxy.go`, `extensions/sdk-rs/src/context.rs`, and `extensions/sdk-py/pig_sdk/__init__.py`: builtin/composed raw Provider retrieval.
- `coding/extension/host/subprocess/runtime-node/runtime.mjs`: the foreign registered-configuration snapshot returned by `getRegisteredProviderConfig`.

Evidence: `TestProviderObjectsAcrossSDKs`, `TestNodeRemoteProviderObjectCarrier`, `TestProviderObjectReferenceLifetime`, and `TestNativeProviderRegistrationWinsBeforeAuthCompletes` cover implemented methods, not full configuration identity. `test/parity/unit-evidence/fin-d78-carriers.md` and `docs/findings/0.3.0-known-gaps.md` distinguish that integrated evidence from subsequent SDK checkpoints. Pi source: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-runtime.ts:438-443,744-797` returns retained objects and creates a fresh shallow effective configuration; `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-registry.ts:162-171` delegates those getters.

Parity allowance: record the named unavailable native SDK members and foreign configuration snapshot identity as known differences. Do not treat registration or method conformance as proof of author-held aliasing. Preserve distinguishing same-process and cross-process assertions; a source checkpoint awaiting integration is not passing evidence for this tree.

Remove when: all SDKs expose the complete raw Provider surface and a specified, race-free cross-process reference mechanism preserves Pi's author/reader aliases, captured children/functions, descriptors, receivers and lifetimes, with isolated/packed/fused caller, cancellation, replacement, cleanup and resource evidence. Re-review the record at each upstream leap and remove closed subscopes independently.

## D79 User-package metadata ignores the invoking project's npm configuration

What: metadata lookups for user-scoped (global) npm packages run from that source's managed npm install root, including an explicit registry source's managed root. PiG retains the caller's selected `npmCommand` argv and user/environment configuration. This applies to explicit package updates and available-update checks, including commands that select npm, pnpm or Bun. Trusted project-scoped packages continue to query from the project cwd. Missing user roots are initialized as managed npm projects; an inaccessible root fails the lookup instead of falling back to the invoking directory.

Why: security. Pi 0.87.1 runs `npm view` in the invoking project even when project settings are denied. A repository's `.npmrc` can redirect global-package metadata requests, expose queried package names and influence update decisions without project approval. The owner selected the minimal cwd policy, not a new package-manager configuration sandbox.

Pi source: `.upstream/v0.87.1/packages/coding-agent/src/core/package-manager.ts:1150-1164` invokes the lookup for updates; `1481-1500` invokes it for available-update checks; `1511-1530` retains the selected command and explicitly passes `cwd: this.cwd`; `2613-2633` forwards that directory to the subprocess. `package-manager-cli.ts:750-756,928-944` supplies the trust-resolved settings but does not isolate native npm configuration.

Scope: user-package metadata only. The approved difference applies even when the invoking project is trusted, because scope determines the lookup directory. Trusted project packages retain Pi's cwd and registry behavior. The user's configuration and explicit command arguments can still select a registry or configuration file. Relative command paths and arguments now resolve from managed storage for user lookups; use absolute paths for wrappers or configuration files that must live elsewhere. This rule does not sandbox package-manager code, scrub the environment or alter self-update ownership.

Call-site marker: `cmd/pig/package_npm_metadata.go`: `getLatestNpmVersion`, the shared scope-to-cwd decision.

Locked by: `cmd/pig/package_registry_scope_test.go` (`TestNpmMetadataLookupScope`, `TestPackageUpdatePerformsScopedMetadataLookup`, `TestNpmMetadataLookupRefusesUnavailableRootAndUntrustedProject`, and `TestNpmMetadataLookupCreatesManagedRootForLegacyInstall`). The selected-command test covers npm, pnpm and Bun argv with both scopes. The real npm loopback scenarios `project-trust/19-user-package-registry-isolation` and `20-trusted-project-package-registry` require a metadata lookup and no reinstall for a current package. The first records PiG's user registry versus Pi's project registry as the expected divergence; the second compares the complete measured result exactly.

Remove when: upstream isolates user-package metadata from the invoking project's configuration with equivalent command/configuration preservation, or the owner explicitly approves a different security boundary.

Approval: approved by owner Michael Kinsy 2026-09-27 (option A).

## D80 Configurable secret-input privacy

What: `maskSecretInput` is a boolean setting with default `true`. `/settings` exposes **Mask secret input** and explains that false restores Pi's plain-text behavior. Masked prompts show up to eight dots, a grapheme count and the last four graphemes. Inputs shorter than five graphemes expose no suffix. Submitted dialog history retains only the preview. The hint reads `Input hidden (PiG default). Show like Pi: /settings → Mask secret input`.

False restores Pi 0.87.1's complete ordinary prompt and submitted-text rendering without the extra count or hint. Ordinary text and manual-code prompts are unaffected. A new dialog captures the setting; change it in `/settings`, then reopen `/login`. Normal project/global precedence applies. Pi ignores the extra JSON key and preserves it when updating shared settings.

Authentication progress and errors redact masked input, including trimmed credential forms. Login input is not appended to Session messages. The authentication flow and authorized credential store still receive the credential: display privacy does not encrypt auth.json or a provider-owned store, and the shown suffix is intentionally visible.

Why: the owner requires verification by length and suffix without echoing a complete secret, with a Pi-compatible opt-out. Pi's `packages/ai/src/auth/helpers.ts:12-16` declares secret prompts, but `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/interactive/interactive-mode.ts:6085-6093` routes them to ordinary showPrompt. The host owns authentication input and diagnostics; the approved default changes Stock PiG's visible behavior without activating a product workflow.

Call-site markers:
- `internal/codingagent/settings.go`: default and persistence.
- `internal/codingagent/slash_session_handlers.go`: the settings row.
- `internal/codingagent/interactive_auth.go`, `interactive_llama.go` and `slash_commands.go`: prompt policy and diagnostic redaction.
- `tui/login_dialog.go`: preview, count, hint and retained content.

Locked by: `TestLoginDialogMaskedPreview`, `TestLoginDialogSecretValueNeverRendered`, `TestLoginDialogMaskDisabledMatchesPi`, `TestMaskSecretInputSettingsRoundTrip`, `TestMaskSecretInputSettingsMenuAppliesToNextDialog`, `TestLoginMaskSettingReachesStandardDialog`, `TestPiIgnoresMaskSecretInputInSharedSettings`, `TestMaskedLoginErrorDoesNotEnterFramesOrSession`, and standard/llama.cpp prompt tests.

Parity allowance: the owner-approved enabled default differs from Pi's plain-text input and is guarded by masked-preview, redaction and persisted-history tests. `test/parity/scenarios/oauth/14-login-secret-mask-disabled.toml` compares the disabled production dialog against real Pi with escaped-output equality.

Remove when: upstream provides equivalent configurable privacy, or PiG removes the option.

Ratification: owner decision 2026-09-27 requires the configurable default-on feature, replacing unconditional masking. D80 retains that approval; its classification here does not change behavior or extend the approved scope.

## D82 Cross-process partial-message observation (RPC33)

What: partial messages crossing the process boundary are independently owned snapshots rather than Pi's live JavaScript references. A delivered partial does not acquire later mutations while retained or queued remotely. The associated `message_start` and `message_update` records can therefore expose different intermediate content, usage or stop state. Intermediate Completions snapshots also omit the named parser scratch properties `partialArgs` and `streamIndex`; Responses snapshots omit `partialJson`. Final messages must omit those properties in both implementations.

Why: Pi's event queue forwards references, and its Agent makes shallow copies after awaited forwarding. Observation occurs at the consumer, not necessarily at the provider's push. A JSON frame cannot remain an alias of a producer's heap object. Removing Go's copies creates data races, while fixed lookahead or unconditional final snapshots change admission and mixed shallow-copy state. Safe continuation/observation work exists separately; it is not integrated merely by recording this boundary.

Observable effect: the strict `rpc/33-rpc-real-provider-records` comparison records PiG's empty/pending assistant start against Pi's parsed read tool call, transient parser fields and `toolUse`. A remote listener that retains an earlier partial does not later see the producer's nested mutations. The raw records remain available and the strict comparison remains a failure, not normalized success.

Scope: cross-process nonterminal partial observation and only the three named transient properties. Same-process observation must remain Pi-exact; this approval does not excuse the integration's earlier native snapshot point. Event presence/order, delta payloads, parsed arguments at their own emission boundary, start before body data, terminal results, persisted messages, cancellation, tool execution and frame ownership are not waived. Arbitrary extension-provider fields are not scratch data covered by this entry.

Owner decision: 2026-09-28, owner Michael Kinsy approves this visible known gap for 0.3.x. This supersedes the earlier no-divergence decision in the RPC33 investigation only for the scope above. It does not approve the rejected unsafe prototype or declare the full faithful-observation work complete.

Call-site markers:
- `ai/event_stream.go`: `Push` takes the snapshot that the current Agent/RPC path observes.
- `agent/agent.go`: `agentAssistantMessage` and `cloneAssistantMessage` copy partial state before subscriber delivery.
- `ai/stream_builder.go`: `snapshotAssistantEvent` freezes nonterminal partial state; parser scratch fields are not part of that message representation.

Evidence: `docs/findings/rpc33-partial-observation.md`, `docs/findings/rpc33-partial-observation-proposal.md`, and `docs/findings/0.3.0-known-gaps.md`. Pi source: `packages/ai/src/utils/event-stream.ts:44-91`, `packages/ai/src/api/lazy.ts:31-61`, `packages/agent/src/agent-loop.ts:408-453`, and `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/rpc/rpc-mode.ts:354-363`.

Parity allowance: `test/parity/scenarios/rpc/33-rpc-real-provider-records.toml` stays enabled with `json_output_equal = true`, `stderr_equal = true`, and three declared runs. Keep its complete raw failure as a known difference; no skip, expected-pass rewrite, field deletion, normalization or reduced durability is authorized. A later passing checkpoint must still qualify the full observation boundary before this record is removed.

Remove when: a specified, race-free observation/continuation mechanism preserves Pi's cross-process observable partial state, including retained shallow nested revisions and scratch cleanup, and passes the unchanged strict RPC33 scenario plus direct-provider/Model-Runtime/Agent tests for both APIs, delayed and buffered input, held listeners, result-only consumption, cancellation and resource lifetime.

## D83 Cross-process event-bus payload identity

What: a foreign-process event-bus listener cannot retain Pi's original payload object. The approved foreign delivery contract is a JSON snapshot captured before listener dispatch, without replaying receiver mutations into the emitter or maintaining a live alias. This identity boundary is separate from D77's current process-local delivery restriction; recording it does not claim that the shared-bus implementation is integrated.

Why: ordinary unproxied JavaScript object writes cannot be intercepted in another address space. An ordered mutation-return channel could replay synchronous-prefix changes but would not preserve retained or post-await aliases. Complete identity requires an explicitly owned shared-reference/proxy design, including lifetime and reentrant behavior, rather than a JSON-copy equivalence claim.

Observable effect: under the shared-bus checkpoint, a foreign listener that increments `data.n` sees its copy change, but the emitting object remains `{n:0}` where Pi observes `{n:1}`. Later listeners and retained aliases need not see that foreign mutation. The integrated process-local bus still provides no foreign delivery under D77; neither that absence nor the later snapshot is described as Pi-exact sharing.

Scope: only cross-process payload identity and mutation visibility. Emitters and listeners in the same Node process keep Pi's actual object, insertion order, synchronous-prefix mutations, reentrant dispatch and post-suspension aliases; their payload must not be JSON-round-tripped. This entry does not waive listener ordering, subscription removal, failed-factory cleanup, errors, scope invalidation or process/resource reclamation. It adds no native SDK bus capability by declaration.

Owner decision: 2026-09-28, owner Michael Kinsy approves the foreign-data boundary proposed by the event-bus owner as a visible known gap for 0.3.x. Approval is not whole-bus parity or permission to discard the distinguishing foreign-mutation assertion.

Call-site marker: `coding/extension/host/subprocess/runtime-node/runtime.mjs`: the process-local event-bus dispatch boundary. The shared-bus intake must carry this marker to its foreign snapshot/dispatch decision, while preserving the same-process reference path.

Evidence: Pi `packages/coding-agent/src/core/event-bus.ts:11-31` passes the same object to its listeners and invokes each synchronous prefix before `emit` returns. `TestNodeRuntimeEventBusMatchesPi`, `TestNodeCellInterleavedGoFactoryKeepsOrderAndBus`, and `test/parity/scenarios/extensions-runtime/52-interleaved-node-admission.toml` protect the integrated same-process path. `docs/findings/0.3.0-known-gaps.md` records the separate shared-bus checkpoint and its raw foreign-mutation failure without assigning this tree its passing tests.

Parity allowance: retain the cross-process `{n:0}` versus `{n:1}` failure as a known difference when the shared-bus checkpoint is integrated. Do not reverse its Pi expectation, skip it or normalize mutations. Same-process paired scenarios remain strict and are not evidence of foreign identity closure.

Remove when: an owned cross-process reference mechanism preserves original payload identity and ordered synchronous, reentrant, retained and post-await mutations with distinguishing Pi/isolated/packed tests and complete cleanup evidence, or upstream adopts the same snapshot contract.
